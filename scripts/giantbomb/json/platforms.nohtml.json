    "description": "The first Amiga computer model, the A1000, was released in 1985 by Commodore Inc.The design team was headed up by Jay Miner and development of the system began in 1982 under the Amiga Corporation company. Commodore acquired Amiga Corporation in the summer of 1984, snatching the Amiga chipset from under the nose of Atari, who originally funded the project. Commodore filed for bankruptcy in 1994, despite the success of the A1200 and CD32.The Amiga range was based on the Motorola 68000 chipset, but made use of proprietary graphics and sound co-processors (codenamed Denise and Paula respectively), which took the load off of the CPU and allowed the Amiga to process more than just gaming graphics extremely efficiently. The Amiga revolutionized video production, providing an affordable CG solution with the Newtek Video Toaster (which later evolved into the Newtek TriCaster, the core of Giant Bomb's video production). It was the first consumer grade computer to be able to sample and record stereo audio in 44.1khz (CD quality) at the time. Over the lifetime of the computer, three graphics and sound chipsets were used: OCS (Original ChipSet), ECS (Enhanced ChipSet) and AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture).AmigaOS The AmigaOS originally was split into two parts, the Kickstarter and the Workbench.The Amiga 1000 required a Kickstarter disc to boot before any other disc could be loaded. The benefits of this were easy OS upgrades (v1.0-1.3), however it also provided an easy vector for the first Amiga viruses to spread. The Amiga 500 onwards stored the Kickstarter (v1.2+) in ROM, thereby eliminating the need for an initial disc boot.The Workbench was an optional windowing system and file manager, similar to Mac OS or Windows. Unlike those systems, games could launch at boot instead of the Workbench in order to give them larger access to system resources.",

    "description": "The Game BoyThe Nintendo Game Boy was one of the first commercially viable handheld game systems on the market being released in 1989. The Game Boy was released in North America in August, 1989, in Japan on April 21, 1989, and in Europe in September 1990. The Game Boy was the first in the Game Boy line, a line that lasted over fifteen years until the release of the Nintendo DS. It was created by the brilliant Gunpei Yokoi, as well as the same team that had developed Nintendo's Game & Watch series. The Game Boy pack-in game was Tetris, a little known puzzle game from Russia that would help lead the Game Boy to its massive success. Minoru Arakawa and several employees from Nintendo of America went to Russia to sign a deal to get the game on their system, they saw it as the equivalent to packing in Super Mario Bros with the NES. Despite the Game Boy's handicap of being able to only display two colors, something that was technically inferior to what other handhelds was offering at the time it was massively more successful. Part of this was due to the fact that the batteries for Game Boy lasted a significantly longer times than those used for other full color handhelds, due to the fact that it used four AA batteries. 1998 saw Nintendo introduce the Game Boy's successor the Game Boy Color; the two systems games were actually compatible with each other, with the entire Game Boy line up playable on the Game Boy Color and a select few Game Boy Color titles playable on the original Game Boy (although not in color). Backwards compatibility became a stable of Nintendo handhelds, Game Boy classic games were playable up until the release of the Nintendo DS.In 1994 Nintendo released an adapter for the Super Nintendo entitled the Super Game Boy, which allowed Super Nintendo players to play Game Boy games on their TV with a limited amount of colors. The adapter did not require the owner to own the original Game Boy system, just the adapter; despite this Game Boy remained as popular as ever. The first variation of the Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket arrived in 1996. It was slimmer, more compact and the first in what would become a Nintendo tradition of releasing multiple variations of their handhelds. The Game Boy managed to sell its shipment of a million units within weeks in the United States and its initial shipment of 300,000 units in Japan in two weeks and reached 500,000 sales in Japan by July. The Game Boy and the color has sold 118.69 million combined worldwide and the Game Boy had sold 66.42 million alone before the release of the color. Twenty years after its introduction, in 2009 the Game Boy was inducted into the Nintendo toy hall of fame.An ad for the Atari Lynx that portrays the Gameboy as underpowered.When it launched in 1989, the Game Boy entered a handheld battle against the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear. Both the Lynx and Game Gear were technologically impressive for the time. They featured full color backlit screens and, in the case of the Lynx, significantly more processing power. Atari and Sega attempted to capitalize on their products' capabilites in advertisements that portrayed the Game Boy as weak and childish. A memorable Sega ad from the time proclaimed that \"The Sega Game Gear separates the men from the boys\". Despite their marketing efforts, the Lynx and Game Gear could not stop the Game Boy's dominance. Their weak battery life (a Game Gear or Lynx could deplete six AA batteries in 4-6 hours), combined with lackluster software libraries and higher prices, proved fatal. There was three different versions of the Game Boy that was released during its life. The Game Boy Light however was only released in Japan.Game Boy ClassicThe Game Boy was released on April 21, 1989 in Japan and then later in August for North America. The classic Game Boy ran on 4 AA batteries which powered the system for around 35 hours. Despite its size and less than perfect monochromatic screen the Game Boy lasted seven years until it received its first update. The Game Boy was only available in grey, in 1995 a \"Play it Loud\" line of the handheld was available in red, green, black, yellow, blue, white and transparent though this line had the exact same specifications. This set a trend of Nintendo handheld's being released in multiple colours. The link cable port is larger than the rest of the Game Boy line which makes it unable to link with all future models of the Game Boy.RAM: 8 kB internal S-RAMVideo RAM: 8 kB internalROM: 8 Mb cartridgesSound: 2 Square Waves, 1 programmable 32-sample 4-bit PCM Wave, 1 White noise, and one audio input from the cartridge.Display: Reflective LCD 160 x 144 pixelsScreen Size: 66 mm (2.6 in) diagonalPower: 4 AA BatteriesDimensions: 148 x 89 x 32 mmWeight: 394g (with batteries)Game Boy PocketThe Game Boy Pocket was originally released July 21, 1996 in Japan and then later released in North America in September 3, 1996. The Game Boy Pocket was smaller, lighter version of the original Game Boy designed to be able to easily fit in your pocket. An additional plus point of the system was that it only needed 2 AAA batteries, though this only powered the system for 10 hours. The Pocket featured a re-designed smaller link port, this version of the port was later used for all later models in the Game Boy line. Another improvement was an improved monochrome screen which did not blur up like on the original. The Game Boy Pocket like the original had no blacklight for darkened area and the first run did not feature a LED to indicate power levels, though due to public outcry a LED was added. The Pocket has been released in silver/chrome, red, yellow, green, black, transparent, pink and the original grey. Some limited editions of the handheld were also released.CPU: Custom 8-bit Sharp LR35902 core at 4.19 MHzRAM: 8 kB internal S-RAMVideo RAM: 8 kB internalROM: 8 Mb cartridgesSound: 2 Square Waves, 1 programmable 32-sample 4-bit PCM Wave, 1 White noise, and one audio input from the cartridge.Display: Reflective LCD 160 x 144 pixelsScreen Size: 66 mm (2.6 in) diagonalPower Supply: 2 AAA BatteriesDimensions: 124 x 76 x 23 mmWeight: 148g (with batteries)Game Boy LightThe Game Boy Light was a Japan exclusive variation of the handheld that was released on April 14, 1998, due to its Japan only release it is one of the rarest Game Boy models. The main selling point was it's indigo coloured backlight that allowed for play in dark environments. The Light ran on two AA batteries and lasted for 20 hours with the light off and 12 with it on. Amazingly none of the consoles that followed the Game Boy Light featured a back lit screen until the 2003 release of the Game Boy Advance SP. The Game Boy Light was only available in Gold and Silver though numerous special editions were released. The Game Boy Light was never released outside of Japan due to the imminent release of the Game Boy Color and Japanese thinking that western gamers wanted color not light.CPU: Custom 8-bit Sharp LR35902 core at 4.19 MHzRAM: 8 kB internal S-RAMVideo RAM: 8 kB internalROM: 8 Mb cartridgesSound: MonoDisplay: LCD (Passive, monochrome, backlit) 160 x 144 pixelsScreen Size: 2.56 inchesPower Supply: 2 AA BatteriesAlleyway BaseballSuper Mario LandYakumanAlleywayBaseballSuper Mario LandTennisTetrisTetrisSuper Mario LandAlleywayBaseballTennisA Game Boy cartridgeThe Game Boy's control was very similar to that of the original Nintendo Entertainment System. It had a D-pad, A and B buttons, and a Select and Start button. On the side of the Game Boy was a volume control, a contrast control, a link cable port, and a jack for rechargeable batteries (instead of just the regular batteries). There was a sliding on-off switch on the top of the handheld a slot for the cartridges, the classic Game Boy cartridges are usable in the entire Game Boy line. The link cable port could also be used for the Game Boy Printer. The link cable was originally designed to allow for head to head multiplayer though Satoshi Tajiri's wildly successful pokemon series revolutionised multiplayer handheld gaming with its focus on trading rather than competitive multiplayer.Tetris (35 Million) *Bundled with the system.Pokemon Red/Blue/Green (20.68 Million Approx)Super Mario Land (18.06 Million)Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins (11.09 Million)Pokemon Yellow (8.86 Million Approx)The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (6.05 Million Approx)Dr Mario (2.08 Million)Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land (1.59 Million Approx)Kirby's Dream Land 2 (1.49 Million Approx)Kirby's Dream Land (1.45 Approx)The game link cable allows for interaction between multiple Game Boy's in certain games. Originally designed for the multiplayer battle mode in Tetris, its most popular use was the transferring of data in pokemon. The game link cable for the original Game Boy was not compatible with any future variations of the Game Boy without the use of the adapter.The Game Boy printer was released in 1998, it was compatible with the Game Boy, Pocket, Color and Advance. It is designed to work in conjunction with the Game Boy Camera, though some Game Boy and GBC games were also usable. It needs 6 AA batteries to run and uses special 3.8 cm Game Boy printer paper.Game Boy CameraIn 1998 Nintendo released the Game Boy camera, it was compatible with the Game Boy, Color, Pocket and Advance. The camera could only take black and white pictures and when used in conjunction with the game boy printer you could print your pictures out. The Game Boy camera was aimed at children who could not afford their own camera, the Camera also had some special features and mini-games to play. The Game Boy Camera was launched in five different colors blue, green, red, yellow and clear purple. There was also some limited editions released such as The Legend of Zelda and Pokemon editions.Nintendo released the Super Game Boy accessory in 1994 for $60. The Super Game Boy allows Game Boy games to be played on your TV screen by using it with your Super Nintendo. It was also compatible with Game Boy Color cartridges, any original Game Boy cartridges you played with your Super Game Boy would still be in black and white, though some later games were programmed to show up in color and display a border around the game.",

    "description": " Sega Game Gear came out in the U.S. in 1991. Work originally began on the console in 1989 under the codename \"Project Mercury\", following Sega's policy at the time of codenaming their systems after planets. Like the Sega Master System, it was an 8-bit system. It was only the third commercially available color handheld console, after the Atari Lynx and the TurboExpress. .It could run on 6-AA batteries or an AC adapter could be used to plug the GG into the wall or outlet. It came packaged with Columns a \" Tetris type\" game, in which you have to match the colored blocks as opposed to making lines.The GG had many accessories. One of them was a TV tuner, which no longer works as of February 2000. Rechargable battery packs to help make the GG portable and not make you keep buying AA batteries every 2 hours, master gear converter to play Master System cartridges on the GG, a car adapter for playing in the car without batteries, and much more.Originally only available in black, the GG was available in other colors. A Japan only release of an ultra-limited (10,000 units) white console in a special metal game case and TV Tuner was available soon after launch. Later a special blue sports themed version and a Coca-cola Red version were available in the US.The Game Gear was built as a \"landscape\" hand-held. This meant that the D-pad and buttons were to the sides of the screen as opposed to being at the bottom like the Game Boy. This made the GG a lot more comfortable to hold because you hands were not so close and crammed together. The Game Gear ultimately played second fiddle to the Game Boy and despite being more popular in Europe it still became the first Sega product to be beaten in sales by a competing Nintendo product in the region.

Known worldwide as the Mega Drive but called Genesis in the US, it provided graphics and sound a couple of steps below their popular System 16 arcade boards. The Mega Drive/Genesis turned out to be Sega's most successful console.",

    "description": "The Sega Genesis Console.Released as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan, Europe, and South America, and as the Sega Genesis in North America, it is Sega's 16-bit console. It was the successor of the 8-bit Sega Master System and predecessor to the 32-bit Sega Saturn.The console hardware had both a Motorola 86000 and a Zilog Z80 CPU which was commonly used in Sega arcade boards at the time--as well as arcade boards in general during the late 80s and early 90s. Sega's goal was to give home gamers a taste of arcade gameplay, made popular by their System-16 arcade boards, where hit games like Golden Axe, Altered Beast, and Alien Syndrome were frequently played in the arcades. An image from the video game Altered Beast was even used as the console box art, to help market it as a 16-bit arcade console. The console was not as powerful as their System-16 and future 16-bit arcade boards, however. The console could only display 64 colors out of 512, compared to 4096 possible colors from their 16-bit arcade boards. And the console could only display 80 sprites on screen, compared to the 128 sprites from their arcade boards. Still, the basic structure allowed for many decent, but not perfect, arcade ports of their games, as well as games from other developers.It had a production run lasting from 1988, when it was first released in Japan, to 1997, when it was finally discontinued. It sold over 40 million units worldwide, over half of which were sold in North America alone. While its performance in Japan was underwhelming, coming third place behind both the SNES and PC Engine, the Mega Drive was Sega's most successful console worldwide, outselling the SNES in the overseas territories of North America, Europe, and South America.The console's best-selling stand-alone game was Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with over 6 million cartridges sold, while its best-selling bundled game was the original Sonic the Hedgehog, with over 15 million units sold.Sonic the Hedgehog proved Blast Processing was real.To make it seem cooler than its main rival, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega's Marketing Department came up with the term \"Blast Processing\" to imply that the Genesis/Mega Drive had more power and was more capable of rendering sprites on screen faster than the SNES. While \"Blast Processing\" was purely a marketing term, the Genesis/Mega Drive did in actuality run at a higher clock speed than the SNES, enabling many games to feature fast scrolling (often with many background layers in parallax) and a large number of sprites on screen.During its nine-year production run, it was expanded upon numerous times. These add-ons included the Power Base Converter, allowing it to play 8-bit Master System games, as well as the Sega CD and the 32X. Additionally, two later models of the Genesis were released.Six Button Controller.The Genesis had two main versions of its controller. The first was slightly larger than the other, with three face buttons and a slightly \"sharp,\" hard-plastic thumb pad. Although this controller was initially well-received, as the popularity of games like Street Fighter II rose, there was demand to produce a six-button controller.Sega finally did release a six-button controller with a slightly streamlined look and feel, a softer thumb pad, and naturally three more face buttons. Many later Genesis games recommended the use of this secondary controller (many of them fighting games), as games that were played with the original controller and designed for the new six-button one would need to tap the start button to switch the three face buttons to the function of the other three.XE-1AP ControllerThe Sega Mega Drive/Genesis supported the following accessories:XE-1AP, released by Dempa Micomsoft only for Japan in 1989. It featured an analog thumbstick, analog slider, four shoulder buttons, and two grip handles. It was supported by After Burner II (1990), Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II (1992), Fastest 1 (1991), Galaxy Force II (1991), and Musha Aleste (1990).Sega Activator, released by Sega in 1993. It allowed full-body motion control, but had limited motion detection.Sega VR, planned for release in 1994 but eventually cancelled. It was a virtual reality headset with head-tracking capabilities.In Japan, the Sega Mega Drive had network service available beginning in 1991. In order to use the service, players had to attach a Mega modem (which had a connection speed ranging from 1,600 to 2,400 bits/s) to the DE-9 port on the console. The few games available for download onto the Mega Drive were Sonic Eraser and Phantasy Star II Text Adventures. In 1995, the service reached Brazil, where two more games were available: Mortal Kombat II and Fifa Soccer '95. The service was not successful, and was eventually discontinued.The Sega Channel provided games directly to your Sega Genesis.Despite this, Sega teamed up with TCI and Time Warner in 1994 to release the Sega Channel in the United States. The Sega Channel was a hardware add-on meant to be placed on top of the Genesis cartridge slot. The add-on allowed players to download games directly to their Sega Genesis consoles and play the games for a monthly fee. They did this by connecting a coaxial cable (the same kind used on cable boxes) to the back of the cartridge add-on. One could then choose to browse games from a variety of menus. Categories like shooter, role playing, platforming, etc. contained many popular Genesis titles people could download and play. After 30 days the games available would change. Usually, the most popular games were kept in service while the games people hardly played were replaced with other games. The Sega Channel also kept track of new games that were released. The games were usually available a month after their official release dates. Japanese import games were also available to subscribers. The activation fee was $29.95, and the monthly fee was $14.95. The service lasted until 1998, when the 32-bit era was established with the Sega Saturn, and the Sony PlayStation. The Sega Channel was also the only way American gamers could play the Genesis last two best games, Alien Soldier and Pulseman.The Sega Nomad, a portable version of the Genesis.The Sega Nomad was a failed handheld version of the Genesis console. Released in October of 1995 at a price of $180 USD, the Nomad featured a 3.25 inch color screen and ran on six AA batteries.Interestingly, the Nomad was a fully functional Genesis home console in addition to being a handheld device. Television connectivity was provided through an A/V slot on top of the unit. For single player games, the Nomad itself functioned as the controller, but two player gaming was possible using a controller port on the bottom of the device. This port accepted standard Genesis controllers.The Nomad suffered from problems that plagued Sega's other handheld, the 8-bit Game Gear. Both machines were notoriously power-hungry thanks to their (relatively) powerful processors and high quality backlit LCD screens. The Nomad was capable of depleting its batteries in two hours, which lessened its appeal as a portable device. Additionally, despite being advertised as a wholly-capable Genesis console, the Nomad was functionally incompatible with the various Genesis add-ons Sega had released such as the Sega CD and 32X. These compatibility problems were due to the shape of the Nomad, and the inability to mount these accessories on its portable form factor.Faced with competition from Nintendo's hugely successful Game Boy, the Nomad faltered at market. By the time Sega ceased production, it had only managed to sell 1 million units.The Sega Genesis launched along with the following 7 games in the US August 14th 1989.Space Harrier IIThunder Force IITommy Lasorda BaseballLast BattleAltered BeastAlex Kidd in The Enchanted CastleGhouls n' GhostsProcessor: Motorola 68000 at 7.6MhzCo Processor: Zilog Z80 at 3.5MhzMaximum Color Palette: 512Maximum Colors On Screen: 64Maximum Sprites On Screen: 80Screen Resolution: 256 x 192 - 320 x 448Possible AV Outputs: RF, Composite, S-Video (Model 3 and Custom Only), Component (RGB)Yamaha 2612 Sound Chip5 Channel FM at 7.6Mhz1 FM/8-bit PCM switcher at 7.6Mhz4 Channel PSG version Ti-SN76489 at 3.5MhzSample Rate 22KHzNote: One of the FM channels can be used as a 8-bit PCM, doing so disables the FM part. The original sample rate of the YM-2612 was 52KHz, however the sound chip was compressed down to 22KHz on the original Model 1 Genesis. Model 2 had both compression and a filter added to mask the distortion caused by lowering the original sample rate. Unfortunately, this didn't work. This is why you hear little distortion on the Model 1 Genesis, and a lot of distortion on the Model 2 version, which eliminated the direct headphone link to the sound chip, and relied on stereo RCA cables instead.Note: The PSG Ti-SN76489 was the same sound chip used in the Sega Master System. This allowed backwards compatibility with the Genesis. This option, however, was abandoned by the time Model 2 was released and became the norm.Main Memory: 64KBVideo Memory: 64KBSound Memory: 8KB (from Z80)Model 1Model 1 is the original design of the Sega Genesis. It has the logo High Definition Graphics above the Sega Genesis label. It has a headphone jack input for stereo sound. Model 1 only supported RF and Mono Composite outputs like the original Nintendo. It has an expansion port for hardware add-ons for things like the Sega CD.Model 2Model 2 was the redesign of the Sega Genesis, shortly after the Super Nintendo became popular. It got rid of the headphone inputs, as this model supported full stereo composite and component outputs. Sadly, the redesign of the circuits caused a sound distortion that made the quality poor. Later, the sound issues were improved somewhat with the VA3 & VA4 motherboards. The Sega CD was also redesigned for Model 2 to fit the new look.Model 3Model 3 came out during the 32-bit era. It's a compact version of the Sega Genesis. It has no expansion slot for add-ons. However, it does have output support for S-Video, which separates the color signal from the contrast making the picture quality much better. S-Video inputs can be found on all modern television sets.Sega Genesis 4. also known as Firecore and Blaze Mega Drive, released in 2008, is an officially licensed console using an software emulator rather than actual hardware, and comes with a selection of games preinstalled (the number varies by region - the US release has 20 games, the European Blaze console has 15), as well as a slot to play Genesis cartridges. It does not support the Sega CD or 32X. The emulator has a number of compatibility problems, such as being unable to play the music for some cartridge based games, most notably Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2.In Brazil another console using model number 4 exists, TecToy Mega Drive 4, which like the Firecore/Blaze uses emulation rather than original hardware, but lacks a cartridge slot, and instead has 87 games pre-installed, some of which are ports of more recent titles, like The Sims 2 and FIFA Soccer 08, as well as an Guitar Hero clone titled Guitar Idol. It does support SD cards for MP3 playback and Rom files.",

    "description": "The Atari Lynx was released in 1989 by Atari Corporation, based upon an Epyx design. The design was completed two years earlier, but Epyx did not have the capital to produce the system themselves. Atari had considered entering the portable market in 1981 with of a portable console called the Atari 2200; a smaller version of the Atari 2600, with an internal screen. This never came to fruition as it was not deemed cost-effective.The Lynx was highly advanced for the time, and was the first handheld console with a fully backlit screen and 16-bit technology. Further, a Lynx is ambidextrous with a simple flip. In 1991, Atari released the updated Lynx II. Slightly smaller than the original and with improved aesthetics, it is still quite large and bulky compared to other contemporary consoles. Over 100 games were released for the system over its life span, and it had an estimated 500,000 user install base worldwide.Criticisms of the console are generally regarding the relatively large size, short battery life, and lack of third-party support. The Nintendo Game Boy and the Sega Game Gear both dominated the market into the early nineties, though the Lynx continued to do well, particularly in Europe. By 1996, Atari ceased production of the system.Today the Atari Lynx still has a dedicated cult following, with some developers and private individuals still making and producing games for the platform. In 2008 the system, and Atari were honored by the 59th annual technology and engineering Emmy awards, for pioneering the handheld gaming platform.CPU - Dual 16-bit CMOS, Mikey & Suzy (16MHZ)Atari Lynx consoleRAM - 64KB DRAM.On Screen Colors - 4096 (16 simultaneous per scan line).Screen Resolution - 160x102 Pixels.Screen - LCD 82.55mm x 47.75mm and (88.9mm/3.5\" diagonal).Sound - 8-bit 4 channel (mono for Lynx I and Stereo sound for Lynx II).Game Cartridge - 2MB (16Mbit).Power Supply - AC adapter or batteries.Battery Life - 4 hours for the Lynx I and 5 hours for Lynx II (6 AA batteries Alkaline).Blue LightningCalifornia GamesElectrocopGates of Zendocon",

    "description": "The gamepad.The Sega Master System is an 8-bit cartridge and card based console released in 1985 for Japan, 1986 for North America, 1987 for Europe, and 1989 for South America. It is based off the Mark III release of Sega's first entry into the Japanese console market, the SG-1000. It competed directly alongside the Nintendo Entertainment System during its heyday, and it was supported by Sega well into the 1990's. The console usually featured a built-in game, such as Hang-On, Space Harrier, a timed maze game featuring a snail, Alex Kidd in Miracle World, Sonic the Hedgehog, or Sonic the Hedgehog 2.The system has 2 9-pin controller ports, with each controller having 2 buttons (labeled 1 and 2) and an 8-way directional pad, created largely due to Nintendo's copyright of their cross bar pad, which caused the SMS controller to have more pronounced diagonals than their competition, but smaller N, S, E, and W controls. The pause button is located directly on the console.While the Master System didn't challenge Nintendo much in the US and Japan, it was a major success in Europe and South America, outselling the NES in those territories. This gave Sega a good foothold in the home console market, which they capitalized on with their more successful follow up, the Sega Genesis. The Master System was still selling in Europe into the late 1990s, and is still selling through to the present day in Brazil, where it remains the best-selling console to this day. The Master System sold 16.39 million units worldwide, including 1.72 million in Japan, 2 million in the United States, 5 million in Brazil, 6.95 million in Western Europe, and 720,000 in South Korea.The Master System's software library was limited in North America and Japan due to Nintendo's restrictive third-party licensing policies, for which the console has been criticized by the North American press. However, the system's reception was far more positive in Europe and South America, regions where Nintendo's restrictive third-party licensing policies did not apply. As a result, the Master System's software library in Europe and South America was significantly larger and more diverse, whereas it was the NES which had a more limited software library in those regions.Hang-OnTeddy Boy BluesHang-OnSafari HuntAction FighterBlack BeltChoplifterFantasy ZoneHang-OnTransbotWorld Grand PrixFurther information: SegaScope 3-D Glasses and Power Base ConverterThe 3D glasses.The Light Phaser.Early models of the console shipped with a Safari Hunt/ Hang On card, one game pad and one light phaser. Missile Defense 3D also made use of the console's SegaScope 3D glasses, which plugged into a card slot device and saw only six games made for it since release. The glasses plugged into a card slot device and used shutters to simulate 3D depth from flickering images on screen. An arcade stick was also released as a peripheral, and a six-button version of the game pad appeared later in the console's life.Sega released an add-on for the Genesis called the Power Base Converter that sat on top of the cartridge slot and allowed for Master System games to be played on the 16-bit console. It has all of the exterior features of the original Master System including a pause button on the device and support for both cartridges and cards.The Light Phaser was was a light gun required to play Safari Hunt and would go on to be featured in games such as Shooting Gallery and Missile Defense 3D.Sega Control StickCPU: 8-Bit Zilog processor running at 3.579545 MHzMemory: 64 Kb RAMVideo: Texas Instruments VDP, 256 x 192 or 256 x 224 resolution, 32 colors on screen (16 for sprites/background, 16 for background only) from a palette of 64Sound: Texas Instruments 4 channel processor (3 Square Wave, 1 White Noise)The Sega Master System (depending on the model) came with one, two, or three games built into its hardware. For the model 1 Sega Master System, the machine pre-programmed with three games. The actual retail quality games were Hang On (Action) and Safari Hunt (Light Phaser Series). However, there is a special exclusively programmed meta-mini-game hidden in the Master System hardware. It is a Snail Maze game that can be accessed through holding both the one and two buttons as well as holding the up potion of the directional square.Sega Handle ControllerThe Sega Master System had multiple forms of solid state software technology that was made compatible for the system. The machine allowed for cartridges in the Mega-Cartridge series. For example, the game Alex Kidd in Miracle World was a Mega-Cartridge game, but later and more advanced games like After Burner used the Four Mega-Cartridge technology. It is unknown at this point if the Sega Master System cartridge technology surpassed the Four-Mega Cartridge. However, there is another variation on this form of software; the implementation of a lithium battery (exactly the same as batteries used for computer motherboards). This addition is indicated with the cartridge suffix descriptor of \"Plus\" or plus battery aided rewritable memory storage. For example, Phantasy Star is classified as a Four-Mega Plus Cartridge. The Plus feature allowed for players to record scores and game progress.Another form of game media for the Sega Master System also had support for game card or \"Sega Cards.\" These were credit card sized solid state form of media that were fed into their own dedicated input slot on the system and tended to be ports of games from Sega's older Japanese console titles. The appeal of this software format was that they held less (only 34KB of space), game cards ended up being cheaper than Sega's Mega Cartridge games. One of the best titles on the Sega Card media is Transbot. It is important to note that the two later model designs of the Sega Master system omit a game card input slot. ",

    "description": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System logoAfter the worldwide success of the NES, and competitors' introduction of more powerful consoles such as the Genesis and Turbografx-16, Nintendo decided it was time to introduce a new home console: the SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System). The machine debuted in Japan on November 21, 1990, and arrived in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia during September of 1991.The SNES was a 16-bit console and a direct competitor to Sega's Genesis. As with the NES, the SNES was the most successful console of its generation in terms of sales. The console triumphed through the support of both Nintendo and third-party developers. The console saw releases from high profile developers such as Capcom, Squaresoft, and Konami. The SNES era is looked back on by many as \"the golden era of video games.\"Nintendo introduced an arcade system called the Nintendo Super System in the early nineties that could be used to preview upcoming Super Nintendo games. Games that appeared on it included Super Mario World, ActRaiser, Contra III: The Alien Wars, and F-Zero.Genesis does what Nintendon't.Nintendo and Sega maintained a fierce rivalry during the 16-bit era. Sega's Genesis was released before the SNES, and this head start allowed the Genesis to gain a substantial sales lead by the time the SNES came to market. Simultaneously, Sega ran an aggressive marketing campaign that portrayed the SNES and its players as slow and childlike when compared to the speedy and \"cool\" Genesis. One of the most notorious of these ads touted the Genesis' (non-existant) \"Blast Processing,\" which ostensibly allowed the Genesis to better render high-speed games such as Sonic the Hedgehog . While the Genesis led the SNES in sales throughout most of the 16-bit generation, the SNES eventually overtook it as the generation ended.The Super Famicom logo in Japan and PAL regionsNEC released the TurboGrafx-16 in 1987 to compete with the incredibly popular NES. Sega released its Genesis the next year. Both of these consoles were based on 16-bit hardware, and were large improvements in sound and graphics over the 8-bit based NES. As Nintendo's dominance in the market began slipping, Nintendo executives began to design a new system (albeit reluctantly at first) as early as 1988.The SNES was designed by Masayuki Uemura, who also designed the original Famicom. The Super Famicom was originally released in Japan on November 21, 1990 for ¥25,000, or about $210. It was a huge hit, with the initial units shipped selling very quickly. With the Super Famicom being such a success, Nintendo dominated over their rivals. This was partially due to the support of third-party developers, such as Capcom, Konami, Square, Enix, and Tecmo.The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released in North America in September 1991. It was a mildly redesigned version of the Super Famicom that originally sold for $199. One of the main selling points for the console was the fact that it was packaged with Super Mario World. Originally, very few titles were shipped upon release, such as Pilotwings, F-Zero, SimCity, and Gradius III, but these titles were all very well-received and showcased the SNES's Mode 7 abilities.Nintendo's policies during the NES era were infamous: Nintendo had to approve every game, third-party developers could release only five games per year (and these games couldn't be released on a rival console within two years), and Nintendo controlled the manufacturing and supply of NES cartridges. When Sega began competing with Nintendo, however, these practices ended. Acclaim was the first developer to release their games for both consoles, and many other developers followed suit.The censored SNES version.Nintendo, however, maintained their strict censorship policy. This was one of the key reasons why the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat sold much better than the SNES version. Nintendo removed all of the gore from the game, including fatalities, while the Genesis version kept these things.Mortal Kombat's gore also sparked US Senators Herb Kohl and Joe Lieberman to call a Congressional hearing to discuss the effect of violent games on children. This meeting caused the founding of the Interactive Digital Software Association (now known as the Entertainment Software Association) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (which applies ratings to all games). Because of these companies being founded, Nintendo decided their censorship policies were no longer needed, and Mortal Kombat 2 was released in an uncensored version on the SNES, which caused it to sell better than the Genesis version.CPU: Custom 65c816 based Ricoh 5A22 running at a selectable 3.58 MHz, 2.66 Mhz or 1.77 Mhz.Memory: 128 Kb main RAM, 64 Kb video RAM, 64 Kb audio RAMVideo: 256 x 224 or 512 x 224 or 256 x 239 or 512 x 239 progressive resolutions, 512 x 448 or 512 x 478 interlaced resolutions, 32,768 colors (256 colors max on screen)Audio: 2 Sony audio processors (1 8-bit, and 1 16-bit DSP) 8 channels, Sample Rate 32KHz, 16-bit stereo outputThe SNES can also take advantage of custom chips provided by the individual game cartridges, like the \"Super FX\" co-processor chip that ran at either 10.5Mhz or 21Mhz depending on the game. Examples include Star Fox, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and Stunt Race FX.The main difference between the SNES and the Super Famicom is the console's color scheme. While purple and blue were used on the North American SNES, the Super Famicom as well as the European and Australian SNES had a logo consisting of rounded green, blue, yellow, and red shapes matching the Super Famicom's and PAL SNES' colored A, B, X, and Y buttons. Additionally, each version of the console has its own version of region lockout, with differently shaped cartridges, rendering a Japanese or PAL version of a game useless on a North American console and vice versa.The SNS-101On October 20, 1997 the Super Nintendo received lighter and more streamlined design in the US. Officially called the SNS-101 it was Nintendo's way of selling more hardware at a cheaper $99.99 USD price point. It was targeted at gamers who where not ready to buy expensive next generation hardware and wanted something with a large library of cheaper games.Pack in games included:The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the PastSuper Mario World 2 : Yoshi's IslandSuper Mario All Stars & Super Mario WorldF-Zero extensively uses Mode 7.Mode 7 is one of the SNES's seven different graphics modes, and the most famous of the seven. It was famous for allowing SNES games to display pseudo-3D graphics, giving the illusion of depth. The mode was able to warp the background layer of a game, changing the perspective to make the background appear to be moving. This was used prominently in a variety of games, to various effects. Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI used it to give the overworld an illusion of movement and size; when the player goes into an airship, the ground below shrinks away as the player gets higher and higher.One limitation of Mode 7 was that it only allowed the background layer to be scaled and rotated. Individual sprites could not have this effect applied to them. So games like Super Castlevania IV and Super Metroid, where characters appear to have that effect applied to them are actually part of the background layer. In Contra III: The Alien Wars, where massive bosses appear to rotate and twist, they actually are the \"background,\" and the background is actually a sprite that changes with the player's movement.Star Fox's 3D graphics are powered by the Super FX chip.There were a variety of first and third party enhancement chips included in SNES games. The most famous of these chips is the Super FX chip, used in games such as Star Fox and Stunt Race FX. However, there are numerous other notable chips, including the GB-Z80, DSP, CX4, S-RTC. The Super FX chip actually works to accelerate the graphics, making the SNES capable of more detailed, and even 3D, graphics. Its effects are seen in many games, including Doom and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island.The GB-Z80 chip was used in the Super Game Boy, and it enabled the SNES to emulate Game Boy hardware effectively. The SNES's processor was not powerful enough on its own. The DSP chip, of which there are several varieties, increases the capabilities of the SNES's Mode 7. The CX4 was a math processor used by Capcom in Mega Man X2 and Mega Man X3, aiding in the formation of trigonometric graphics. The S-RTC was used in one game (Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2) to power a real-time in-game clock.Super Mario WorldF-ZeroSuper Mario WorldF-ZeroPilotwingsSuper SoccerSuper TennisSuper R-TypeF-ZeroNintendo eventually planned to partner with Sony to develop a CD-based add-on for the console. Sony went on to develop a console referred to as \"Play Station,\" which would play SNES CD releases as well as standard carts. After various disagreements between the two companies, the partnership was dissolved and Nintendo looked to Phillips to produce a similar CD-based add-on for the popular 16-bit console. The partnership between Nintendo and Phillips wouldn't result in the release of a SNES CD drive, but the deal eventually resulted in Nintendo's characters appearing in a small number of Phillips-produced titles for its own multimedia console, the CD-i. Meanwhile, Sony would reuse the PlayStation name when developing its own CD-based console.Secret of Mana was said to be originally envisioned as a SNES CD release. Once the project was killed, the game was retooled to run on the standard cartridge format.",

    "description": "The Amstrad CPC 464 was the first of the CPC series released on the 21st June 1984. it quickly became one of the most successful home computers in Europe. More than two million CPC 464s were sold in total between 1984 and 1990.Despite its lack of stand-out features from competitors such as Commodore and Sinclair, it gained popularity from its low price and the fact that the computers were sold as a complete unit, comprising of CPU/keyboard, built-in tape recorder and monitor (optional monochrome green or colour). Competitor computers such as the ZX Spectrum came only with the CPU/keyboard, requiring a separate monitor.CPC 472The CPC 472 was a Spanish version of the CPC 464 with an additional, non-functional 8KB RAM. A Spanish law required that every computer with up to 64KB should have extra keys for the Spanish language, or an extra tax would be levied. So Amstrad soldered in an extra 8KB which was not, however, usable by the machine since it was not connected to anything else. Later on Amstrad released a 472 with a proper Spanish keyboard. After the rule changed there was also a CPC 472 with non-Spanish keys available for a very short time. Today, the CPC 472 is very rare.CPC 664Released in In June 1985, the CPC 664 is essentialy the same hardware as the previous CPC 464 with a floppy disc drive taking the place of the cassette drive and a new easier to type keyboard.CPC 6128Amstrad launched the CPC 6128 shortly after the CPC 664 for the American market . The new machine had 128KB of memory and a sleeker appearance, but was otherwise identical to the 664.The machine was launched in Europe shortly afterwards, replacing the 664 for the same price.The last models in the Amstrad CPC range were the Amstrad 464 Plus, Amstrad 6128 Plus, and the short lived Amstrad GX4000, a standalone console aimed squarely at the burgeoning home console market.All launched together in 1990. The CPC name is said to have been dropped because of a legal dispute with a French firm, though it is also likely that \"CPC 6128 Plus\" was considered too unwieldy a name and one redolent of the machine's mid-80s heritage.Described as a solution of \"too little, too late\", this was Amstrad's second effort to prolong the life of its 8-bit computer series in the face of fierce competition from new 16-bit machines (notably, the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga). The Plus series were mostly (but not quite 100%) compatible with the original CPC computers, and incorporated a list of new features, like a cartridge port for instant program loading, DMA for the AY soundchip, hardware scrolling, programmable interrupts, 16 hardware zoomable sprites (not vectorized) with an independent palette of 15 colours, and a choice of 4096 colours all in a new, sleek case which mimicked the keyboard-computer design that was en vogue in the 16-bit market (ST, Amiga etc). While the Amstrad Plus computers were arguably one of the best 8-bit computers ever built for the mass market, they died an early death as the 16-bit era had well and truly begun.",

    "description": "Jobs and Wozniak.The \"Apple ][\" as it was initially branded was released in 1977 and was the follow-up effort to the Apple-1 which was born from the mind of one Steve Wozniak. Even before fully completing the Apple-1 though, Wozniak was already dreaming of bigger and better things. A major goal he set in creating his next machine--the Apple ][--was to have it display in color. As he worked with potential hardware changes he began to realize the potential of the Apple ][ more and more. His previous experience with the game Breakout on the Atari 2600 motivated Wozniak to essentially ensure the Apple ][ could be a great gaming machine. After Wozniak set up the new computer to display in color, he naturally continued on to add sound and then paddle control to the Apple ][. The Apple ][ was now a full blown gaming machine.Though the designs of the Apple-1 and later the Apple ][ were basically Steve Wozniak's efforts alone, Steve Jobs played a very important role in establishing the visual appearance of the Apple ][. While Wozniak wouldn't think twice about extra wires hanging about on a computer that worked, Jobs knew how to make an appealing package for people outside the once very niche computer enthusiast group. The Apple ][ was made to look quite different from other similar machines on the market. It had a much more user-friendly aesthetic. It almost looked like a typewriter but at the same time was \"futuristic\" enough to clearly be seen as a computer. The case was user-friendly as well. It was easily removable which was rare at the time. Most similar devices warned against any type of self-service and didn't welcome exploration.Since Steve Wozniak designed the Apple ][ to be a gaming machine, it ended up being really successful as one. There wereMystery House.countless games either designed specifically for the Apple ][ or ported over from arcade versions or other systems versions over the years. One of the most important games to come from the Apple ][ early on though was a game called Mystery House. This was the first adventure style game to feature graphics of any kind. all previous games of this style were purely text based. A worthwhile side note is that Mystery House was created by Ken and Roberta Williams who went on to start the company Sierra Entertainment, Inc. As previously mentioned, there were many ports of games that came to the Apple ][. Just a few of these titles include popular games such as:Paper BoyDig DugDonkey KongManiac MansionBad DudesA Mind Forever VoyagingAliens:The computer gameArkanoidArkanoid IIDynastyDepth ChargeF-15 Strike EagleImpossible MissionImpossible Mission IIPrince of PersiaStar Trek: The Kobayashi AlternativeMost commercial software was provided on 5.25\" floppy diskettes, but the earliest and cheapest disk drives of the era could only read one side at a time. This resulted in larger games being shipped on multiple, more expensive double-sided diskettes, and because there was no hard drive to install the software on to it, prompts would appear instructing the user when to swap or flip the diskettes to continue.Even though the graphics were often pared down as the Apple ][ became older, it still provided Apple owners with roughly the same experience of these games. The Apple ][, along with machines like the Amiga, the Atari 400 and 800, and the Commodore 64 (to an extent), single-handedly drove the microcomputer gaming era beginning in the late 70s.The Apple ][ was a very versatile computer in terms of hardware and software. The Apple ][ was actually the leader as a platform for launching new and unique hardware gadgets for quite some time after its initial launch in 1977. The popularity of the Apple ][ series kept it on the cutting edge of hardware/peripheral development until about 1991. That's nearly 15 years of hardware development for a single platform. Standard hardware components were included the Apple ][, such as keyboard, RAM, CPU, etc. The first Apple ][ models were built and shipped with 4K of memory, upgradable via expansion ports up to 48K. The Apple ]['s various expansion ports proved very useful for the many possible hardware upgrades to come in the future.Hardware expansions were very common despite not always being very compatible or universal. Some of the general \"upgrades\" one could purchase and install included:Interface CardsVideo CardsROM/RAM expansion cardsCo-ProcessorsAcceleratorsPrintersAlternate Input Devices (joysticks, paddles, etc.)The earliest Apple ][ keyboards are notable for not having a CAPS LOCK key, because the system typeface included in ROM had no lower-case letters. Graphical fonts could be used by applications to overcome this limitation, as the keyboard did have a Shift function for typing symbols placed above the number row.The Apple logo on the case was emblazoned with a rainbow of stripes to signify the system's ability to produce color. Display monitors sold with the Apple ][ were generally monochrome, commonly in green or amber. The video capabilities of the system, however, were based on the NTSC video standard. Hooking up a normal household television to the computer would allow for compatible games and applications to display in a small but variable color palette, depending on the video mode used and the technique of signal modulation.The Apple II PlusThe Apple ][ Plus hardware was introduced to market in June 1979. Upgraded features included a ROM-integrated version of the Applesoft II BASIC programming language (supplied by Microsoft), and a much larger 48K bank of RAM now expandable to 64K.The inclusion of the BASIC programming language in every model sold, rather than having to purchase it separately, provided a greater opportunity for every end user to explore programming and naturally game development on the system. Computer enthusiast magazines of this era would often include several pages of BASIC code that a user would painstakingly type in by hand, to run various utility or entertainment programs, some even including primitive graphics. In the event of an error in the printed code, a user could attempt debugging, or simply wait for the next magazine issue to print a correction.",

It included an 8mhz Motorola 68000 CPU and 512kb RAM. Later models, called STFM, had a built-in floppy disk drive, RF-modulator and had the power supply built into the case. \"ST\" means Sixteen-Thirtytwo, because of the CPU's 16bit data bus and 32bit internals.It became popular in businesses because of the excellent office applications, in the homes of people because of the great games and amongst musicians because of its built-in MIDI ports and software like Cubase. The Atari ST was in direct competition with Commodore's Amiga and Apple's Macintosh line of computers, and to some extent the Amstrad CPC line of computers. The developement was lead by Jack Tramiel, who had recently left Commodore (Tramiel actually started the Commodore company and developed among other computers the C64.) to buy the rights to the Atari name. The Atari ST was intended to be an affordable computer with fast performance. But because it was supposed to be affordable, it is not as powerful in the audio and graphics department as the Commodore Amiga. Focus was instead put on including a fast CPU and lots of RAM.These are the basic specifications for the Atari 520ST:CPU: Motorola 68000 16/32bit @ 8mhz. 16 bit data bus/32 bit internal/24-bit address bus.RAM: 512kb (1mb for the 1040ST models)Soundchip: Yamaha YM2149F 3-voice squarewave plus 1-voice white noise mono PSG(plus 2 channels on the STE models).Diskdrive: Single-sided 3½\" floppy disk drive. 360kb capacity(1040ST had double-sided drives which had a capacity of 720kb).Display: 60 Hz NTSC, 50 Hz PAL, 71.2 Hz monochrome:Low Resolution - 320×200 (16 color), palette of 512 colorsMedium resolution - 640×200 (4 color), palette of 512 colorsHigh resolution - 640×400 (mono), monochromePorts: TV out (on ST-M and ST-FM models, NTSC or PAL standard RF modulated), MIDI in/out (with 'out-thru'), RS-232 serial, Centronics parallel (printer), monitor (RGB or Composite Video colour and mono, 13-pin DIN), extra disk drive port (15-pin DIN), DMA port (ACSI port, Atari Computer System Interface) for hard disks and Atari Laser Printer (sharing RAM with computer system), joystick and mouse ports (9-pin MSX standard).Operating System: TOS (The Operating System) with the GEM user interface.There are a couple of different models of the Atari ST. They are:Atari 130ST - Never released. Was supposed to come with only 128kb ram. But the operating system alone took up almost all that amount, so they canceled it.Atari 260ST - Only released in Europe. It was first only a prototype just like the 130ST but was eventually released in Europe. It is identical to the 520ST and was released to differentiate it from the new 520ST+.Atari 520ST - The original model described in Specifications.Atari 520STM - Model with only RF modulation built in, without floppy drive. Not very common.Atari 520STFM - Built-in floppy drive, RF modulator and power supply.Atari 520ST+ - 1mb RAM but no floppy drive.Atari 1040STF - A 520ST with built in double sided DD disk drive and 1mb ram. But without RF modulator.Atari 1040STFM - A 520ST with built in double sided DD disk drive, 1mb ram and RF modulator.Mega ST - Redesigned motherboard. Comes with 2 or 4mb of RAM. Includes a real-time clock and an internal connector for expansion.

The sound chip has 2 extra channels that can be used for sampled sounds. The color palette is extended to 4096 colors. Unfortunately the STE specific features were rarely used in commercial software.Mega STE - Same hardware as the 1040STE has, but with a 16mhz CPU.STacy - A portable version of the ST.ST BOOK - Portable version of the STE. It was more portable than the STacy but sacrifice many features in order to achieve that.Prototypes/Vaporware (Never Officially Released)1040 STE+ (STE 2080) – Similar to the 1040STE but with a additional, intern AMD 80286 CPU and a 40MB HD (2,5\")The operating system in the Atari ST is called TOS which means simply \"The Operating System\". It combines the GEM GUI and the underlying GEMDOS, a DOS like operating system, both by Digital Research. TOS is stored in onboard ROM chips, though early versions of the Atari ST came with TOS on floppy disks. Because it is stored on ROM chips it boots up instantly. Some people jokingly says that TOS means \"Tremiel Operating System\", since Jack Tremiel was the one leading the developement of the Atari ST.TOS is composed of the following parts:GEMDOS - GEM Disk Operating System (A DOS-like operating system Digital Research had experimented with a little bit before Atari decided to use GEM.)GEM - Graphical Environment Manager (A graphical environment. GEM itself consists of AES, VDI and GEM Desktop.)AES - Application Environment Service (Provides the window system, window manager and other GUI elements.)VDI - Virtual Device Interface (The core graphics system of the GEM engine.)GEM Desktop (An application using AES to provide a file manager and application launcher.)BIOS - Basic Input/Output SystemXBIOS - Extended BIOSLine-A (Low-level high-speed graphics calls.)GDOS - Graphics Device Operation System (Sends commands from VDI to the proper device driver for rendering graphics.)AHDI - Atari Hard Disk Interface (Driver for Hard Drive. Has to be loaded seperately.)The GEM desktop in low resolution (320x200)The desktop looks like most other desktops in that it uses icons to represent devices and files, and has windows and dialog boxes. The standard desktop has a trashcan and two floppy disk icons, even if you only have one floppy drive. On the top part is a context sensitive panel. It changes it's contents depending on the application (much like on a Macintosh), though applications are not required to even use the panel in which case it is removed.TOS can execute a variety of different filetypes. They can be identified by their extensions:*.ACC - Desktop accessory. Loaded automatically when the application loads.*.APP - Application. Was not used very often.*.PRG - Executable program. Often GEM programs.*.TOS - Programs that only uses GEMDOS and not the GEM system to function. (i.e. it doesn't use GEM to draw windows.)*.TTP - TOS Takes Parameters. Opens up a dialog box in which you can add arguments for the program.It is possible to autoboot TOS programs (but not GEM programs) on startup by placing the program inside a folder named \"AUTO\" on a floppy disk. If the floppy is inserted into the drive when the computer boots, it will bypass the GEM desktop and boot the TOS program instead. This is used by many demos and most games.The look and feel of GEM for Atari ST is very much like the one in the original Macintosh. Apple sued Digital Research over this and Digital Reasearch had to redesign their GEM window manager for other architectures. But since it was mostly Atari who developed the Motorola 68000 version, they were given the rights to further develop the 68k version without Digital Research's consent. Because of this, Atari was not affected by the Apple-Digital Research lawsuit and were allowed to have a more Mac-like look and feel.\"Virtual Escape\" demo by EquinoxAs with most other early computers, there is a scene of people still active on the Atari ST platform. They use the ST to create productions called \"demos\", which is a program demonstrating the demo group's programming, graphics making and music composing abilities on limited hardware.The groups came up with new programming techniques to push the limits of the computer to do things that people would've only dreamed about doing years ago. Some of these techniques were later used in games for the Atari ST. For example the technique to display graphics in the borders of the screen.\"Death of the left border\" screen by TNT Crew.Since the Atari ST was not powerful enough to display graphics in fullscreen, Atari put borders on the sides of the screen. But after many years of experimenting, people in the demo scene removed those borders one by one, starting with the upper border. The last border to be removed was the left one that was thought to be impossible to remove. But once again a demo group succeeded with removing the border and were finally able to display graphics in fullscreen. Of course, this had an impact on performance, so you couldn't do everything you could do otherwise.The people in the demo scene on the Atari ST were also very involved in the game side of things. Some demo groups even started their own game companies and made some of the best games for the ST with the techniques they had invented, like the mentioned ability to put graphics where the borders should have been.One example of this is in the game Lethal Xcess. Thalion Software who made the game, put the HUD in the upper border of the screen so that the playing field wouldn't be smaller. Thalion Software was comprised of people from various demo groups and made some of the best games for the Atari ST, like Amberstar and Enchanted Land. Demo groups still release games, though not commercially like Thalion did.",

    "description": "The Commodore 64 (C64) is an 8-bit home computer released in August of 1982, and was the third system made by Commodore International. The starting price was $595 USD. The computer was named for its 64 kilobytes of RAM; superior to most mainstream personal computers at the time. The C64 is occasionally rendered: C=64 due to the original system's use of the \"commodore symbol\" which resembles a 'C' merged with an equal sign.Commodore 64The Commodore 64 began development when Commodore Inc. bought MOS Technology. Unable to sell their technology in the mass market, MOS Tech approached Commodore in hopes of collaborating with their latest 6501 microprocessor. MOS had hoped to sell the microprocessor to console manufactures, but Commodore had other plans. MOS was also eager to sell their new SID sound chip in hopes that partnering with Commodore would give them an edge in the digital sound market. The iconic sound of the MOS SID chip was considered groundbreaking at the time, and video game sound composers used it to create entire in-game audio tracks.Jack TramielJack Tramiel, founder of Commodore Business Machines, felt that the microprocessor was perfect for the new line of computers he had in mind. The chip would be the main microprocessor for the VIC-20.The project was given to Commodore Japan; an engineering team led by Yash Terakura created the VIC-1001 for the Japanese market. The VIC-20 was marketed in Japan as VIC-1001 before VIC-20 was introduced to the US. The VIC-20 became a massive success.Tramiel wanted to expand with the success of the VIC-20, but wanted a more powerful computer, while retaining a low price.Yash TerakuraCommodore began a game console/computer hybrid project that would use the new chips—called the Ultimax, or alternatively the Commodore MAX Machine, engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market. The Commodore MAX hardware was the basis for the Commodore 64, and was the first computer of the C64 hardware family.During the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, the Commodore 64 was announced to enthusiasm. When the C64 was rolled out, it had an extremely low $595 price tag. Companies such as Intel and Atari had no idea how Commodore was making money on the computer. In reality, Commodore was using new and sometimes untested tech for their computer as opposed to licensing older tech from large competing corporations.C64 Version of KaratekaThroughout its 12 year lifespan, the C64 sold over 17 million units. As such, it remains one of the best-selling personal computer models of all time. From 1983-1985, the Commodore 64 dominated the personal computer market with a 40% share. It then went on to outsell former market leaders Apple and Intel, and led Commodore to winning the personal computer market war. Its successor, the Commodore 128, was released in 1985 and was fully backwards compatible with most C64 software but was far less successful than the C64.In all, about 10,000 commercial software were made for the C64, including development tools, office applications, games, and more. The C64 is currently used by hobbyists, and C64 games are available for purchase on the Wii Shop Channel in Europe and the United States.CPU: 8-bit MOS Technology 6510, 1.023 MHzMemory: 64KB RAMGraphics: MOS Technology VIC-II, 16 colorsSound: MOS Technology SID 6581/8580SID 6581The Commodore 64's SID chip played a prominent role in the development of video game music, chiptunes, and the demo, crack, and warez scenes. SID (itself an acronym for Sound Interface Device) was created by Robert Yannes, an engineer who later moved to the synthesizer industry. Yannes stated that he felt previous computer sound chips had been designed by people who did not understand music, and sought to design a chip that would be useful for musicians. Previously, there had been a single chip for both audio and video, so a dedicated chip for audio provided musicians with much more freedom and range.The initial run of the SID chip, the SID 6581, was extremely popular, and instrumental in the success of the Commodore 64. It allowed for much more freedom comparative to previous chips, such as three oscillators, each of which could produce four separate waveforms. Additionally, many composers were able to find loopholes to make their music even more complex, such as a glitch that essentially created a fourth channel for 4-bit samples. Some games that took advantage of this were Impossible Mission and Ghostbusters, both of which used voice samples.Many cracktros, such as this one, took advantage of the SID's capabilitiesMany well-known composers and developers had their start with the SID chip, such as Rob Hubbard and Martin Galway. These men have contributed to such games as Arkanoid, Wizball, Yie Ar Kung-Fu, Commando, Monty on the Run, and Skate or Die!. The composition process was initially very rough; composers would have to input a sequence of hexadecimal bytes where each line would describe the note, pitch, length, etc. of the sound being played.By the mid-1980s, SID musicians were improving to a point where they could effectively emulate \"real\" music. Games such as Times of Lore were able to use mainstream songs as inspiration, and adapt that to a SID song. Also at this time, demo groups began to rise in popularity, with several Commodore 64 magazines releasing songs from their readers. The impact of SID music is evident as well, with songs still being developed to this day. While many musicians utilize emulation, some continue to use the original SID chips.",

Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders he had proposed the MSX standard as a single industry standard for home computers. This was many years before the PC later became a standardized home computer architecture.The MSX standard was first formally announced in 1983 and was followed by three other standards: MSX2 (1986), MSX2 (1988) and MSX turbo R (1990).Over a hundred different companies have manufactured MSX computers. The list of companies includes: Sony, Panasonic, Sanyo, JVC, Spectravideo, Toshiba, Canon, Casio, Dragon, Dyndata, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Sharp/Epcom, Pioneer, Alalamia, Mitsubishi, NEC, Philips, Radiola, Schneider, Talent, Telematica, Yamaha, Yashica, Aster International, General, Samsung, Hyosung, Limco, Oric, Radofin.Although it was developed by Microsoft's Japanese partner, Microsoft itself showed little support for the project beyond making the system software, and the MSX-based machines were seldom seen in the United States. Most of the Japanese companies decided to avoid the intensely competitive U.S. market, only Spectravideo and Yamaha decided otherwise. The MSX computers became popular in Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Netherlands, France, Spain, Finland, Kuwait and former Soviet Union.

    "description": "The Sinclair ZX Spectrum was the successor to the ZX 81 released in the UK by Sinclair Research Ltd. in 1982. Affectionately regarded as the \"Speccy,\" the Spectrum was Sinclair's first computer capable of color output, and is widely recognized for its complex 40-key rubber keyboard. The ZX Spectrum was particularly successful in the UK, and was one of the most popular personal computer throughout Europe in the 1980s. The popularity of the Spectrum in Europe can be compared to that of the Commodore 64 in North America as it was made to be the cheapest available color computer at the time. It was a well supported platform with a variety of companies developing software for it, including many games. There were eight models of the Spectrum produced between 1982 and 1987, and the recognizable computer spawned a good deal of clones and imitators.CPU - Zilog Z80A 3.5 MHz processorMemory - 16 Kb / 48 Kb / 128 KbVideo - 256 x 192 resolution, 15 colors (7 shades bright mode for each black), each 8 x 8 pixel square limited to a max of 2 colors.Audio - 16K / 48K models have 1 channel with 1-bit sound using a 10-octave built-in beepe. 128K model has 3 channels of 4-bit sound using an AY-3-8912 sound chip. Some 48k models use the AY chip.Media - Cassette tapes via the cassette recorder peripheralBuilt-in Language - Sinclair BasicKeyboard - QWERTY layout with 40 rubber keys. Keys have up to 6 functions each.Size/Weight - 23 x 14.4 x 3 cm / 550gIO Ports - Expansion port, RF video outPower Supply - External PSU, 9v DC, 1.4AThe 16K model was the entry level model manufactured by Sinclair in 1982. It launched alongside the 48K model and was very similar except for the memory difference. The original ZX Spectrum is very widely recognized for its signature rubber keyboard and rainbow flair in the corner of the device. It was small, easy to use and cheap. The 16K model launched at £125 and later dropped to £99. A 32K RAM upgrade was available for 16K users to upgrade their systems to 48K. Users could mail in their systems and they'd have their Spectrums fitted with a 32K daughterboard that made it essentially identical to the 48K model. An interesting note is that to save money on these RAM expansions, Sinclair used defective 64K chips with only 32K RAm actually working or available. Third parties released 32K RAM expansion packs that plugged into the expansion port as well.The keyboard of the computer is considered to be terrible for typists. The rubber keys are mushy, and the fact that keys can have up to 6 functions each means that even typing basic commands requires extensive use of the function keys. The 256x192 resolution of the computer was above average for its time, and the choice of 8 colors (15 including \"BRIGHT\" colors) set it apart from the competition. The downside to the Spectrum's color was that only two colors could be in a single 8x8px square. This caused a problem called attribute clash (also known as color clash) which required creative graphic design to circumvent.The 48K model launched alongside the 16K model in 1982 and retailed for £175. The price was later reduced to £129. The 48K model is virtually the same as the 16K model, with the obvious exception being the upgraded RAM.In 1984, two years after the release of the original Spectrum, Sinclair released the upgraded ZX Spectrum+. The ZX Spectrum+ was a 48K Spectrum in a Sinclair-QL style case (another computer launched in 1984). The most important change with the Spectrum+ was the introduction of a \"professional keyboard\" which had injection-molded plastic keys rather than rubber ones. The keys still rested on a rubber membrane and while it improved upon the original design, many users did not find it completely satisfactory.The ZX Spectrum+ retailed for £179.95 and a do-it-yourself upgrade kit was released for £50, which allowed a user to upgrade any rubber-keyed Spectrum with plastic keys. The price was cut to £129.95 with the release of the Spectrum 128. The plastic keys on the Spectrum had a tendency to fall off, and retailers expressed failure rates ranging from 5% to as high as 30%.The Spectrum 128 was an evolution of the ZX Spectrum lineup, sporting 128K RAM, 3 channel audio, MIDI compatibility, a serial port, RGB video out, 32Kb ROM, an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad. The Spectrum 128 also fixed the \"dot crawl\" problem that earlier units suffered from. It was developed by Sinclair in conjunction with their spanish distributer Investronica. It was unveiled and launched in Spain in 1985 for 44,250 pesatas; the English release was pushed back until 1986 because of unsold Spectrum inventory and retailed for £179.95. The English Spectrum 128 did not include an external keypad and the keypad port was renamed \"AUX.\" The keypad was released separately for £19.95 and did not sell well.The Spectrum 128 suffered from being released after the holiday season to an uninterested public. The new hardware had compatibility issues with old software and peripherals. Months after the Spectrum 128 was launched, Amstrad took over Sinclair's computing business and discontinued the Spectrum 128. It only retailed for about half a year.The Amstrad ZX Spectrum +2 was the first Spectrum-branded computer released after Amstrad acquired the Sinclair brand and computing business. It was released in 1987 for £139–£149 and marked a huge turning point for the Spectrum brand. It was the first Spectrum to be released with a proper spring-loaded keyboard, two joystick ports, and a built in tape recorder. The case is dark gray and similar to the Amstrad CPC 464.The computer was also released in black as the ZX Spectrum +2A with the revised motherboard of the Spectrum 3. The internals were similar to those of the Spectrum 128, except the ROM was changed around a bit causing further incompatibility issues. A ZX Spectrum +2B followed in late 1987 when manufacturing of the machine moved from Hong Kong to Taiwan, but the internals remained identical. But before they made these in taiwan they made these in the ukThe Spectrum +2 was the first Spectrum marketed almost exclusive as a game machine, and as a result it sold very well. One of the Spectrum +2 bundles was the James Bond 007 Action Pack, which game with a light gun and James Bond games.The Spectrum +3 marks the final and most advanced Spectrum computer, and was released in 1987 for £249, with a price drop bringing it down to £199. It remained in production until 1990. It featured a 3\" floppy disk drive, a parallel print port, and a new ROM. The Spectrum +3 also had a revised motherboard with drastically fewer chips than previous models. Continuing the trend of new Spectrum models, this more advanced computer was even more severely incompatible with old software and hardware. The 3\" floppy drive used proprietary Amstrad disks and the computer as a whole was drastically overpriced compared to more advanced competing computers at the time such as the the Amiga 500.Like the Spectrum +2, the Spectrum +3 was marketed as game device and sold in various \"action packs\" however it did not enjoy nearly the same success as its predecessor. The incompatibilities, 3\" Amstrad floppy drive, and most importantly death of the 8-bit computer market all contributed to the computer's eventual failure and the end of the Spectrum line.The ZX Spectrum is perhaps the most cloned computer line in all history. Sinclair licensed the Spectrum's design to Timex and a North American derivative named the Timex Sinclair 2068 was released. This \"official\" clone was largely incompatible with Sinclair software and within two years of the Timex-Sinclair partnership, Timex dropped out due to huge losses. Many more illegal clones were produced in countries such as the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hong Kong, Argentina, Brazil and Spectrum clones continue to be produced in Russia. The SAM Coupe is often considered a Spectrum clone because of its emulated Spectrum compatibility, as well as the fact it was produced by a Spectrum peripheral manufacturer. Dozens of clones and variants of the ZX Spectrum are known to exist.The ZX Spectrum had a very simple architechture but an extraordinarily diverse software library consisting of over 14,000 titles. Software applications included programming language implementations, Sinclair BASIC extensions, word processors, databases, office software, artist tools, music composition, and a great deal of games. Spectrum software was originally distributed on cassette tapes, read in with the tape recorder expansion. Load times were very long and could be anywhere from 3-12 minutes depending on the size of the program. While data on cassettes was reliable and widely used, the release of the Spectrum 3 with its build in floppy drive brought about around 700 floppy disk titles to the Spectrum's library throughout the decade after its release.3D DeathchaseAll or NothingBatman: The MovieBoulder DashChase H.Q.DizzyHead Over HeelsJet Set WillyMagicland DizzyManic MinerMidnight ResistanceOperation WolfR-TypeRainbow IslandsRebelstarRoboCopRoboCop 2Stop the ExpressTarget: RenegadeThe SentinelTornado Low LevelA few first party peripherals were released for the ZX Spectrum including:ZX Printer - This was already on the market when the Spectrum was released.

Only 10 games were commercially produced on ROM cartridges.ZX Microdrive - A small, fast, and somewhat unreliable tape-roll storage medium released by Sinclair.A very popular third party peripheral was the Kempston Joystick Interface. It allowed the user of controllers complying with the Atari 2600 standard to be used in Spectrum games and was greatly supported. Many other peripherals were released such as disk drives, controller interfaces, serial interfaces, RAM upgrades, speech synthesizers, a drum kit and even a modem.",

    "description": "The Macintosh was designed as part of a skunkworks operation originally headed by Jef Raskin. Raskin planned to create an easy to use and affordable appliance computer for use by ordinary people. The project was ongoing at the same time as Apple founder Steve Jobs was leading development of Lisa, Apple's intended flagship computer. Despite his heavy involvement in the inital stages of the Lisa project, Jobs eventually caught wind of the Macintosh project and gradually turned his full attention to it. In 1981, Raskin departed the team over a dispute with Jobs, making Steve the de facto leader.The Original MacintoshIt was under Jobs that the Mac became a GUI-oriented computer, influenced by a tour given to Apple staff of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center which included looks at PARC's Alto computer and the related Smalltalk software. The computer eventually released in 1984 as a vertically-oriented all-in-one and was gradually revised over the course of the decade. Eventually, Apple began to offer Macs in different formats, ranging from standard desktops to early laptops and other portable designs.The Mac's popularity was at first fairly high, but after Steve Jobs was stripped of power within Apple (eventually departing to form NeXT), executives who did not fully understand the platform began to devalue it (notably, Apple was criticized in the nineties for offering an absurd amount of Macs which were too similar and had generic names) and the platform struggled. To compound these problems, Apple's Mac System (later Mac OS), the OS powering the Macs, was hopelessly outdated and needed replacing.Unfortunately, Apple's internal software R&D had become bloated and ineffectual, stalling development on the next-generation Mac OS codenamed Copland. In 1996, Apple wrote it off as a sinking ship and decided to source the basis for their next-generation operating system from elsewhere. Several options were considered, such as licensing Microsoft's NT architecture and purchasing Be, Inc. for its BeOS. In the end though, it was Apple founder Steve Jobs and his NeXT outfit which Apple decided to buy, allowing them to base what would become OS X (as in the roman numeral for 10) on NeXT's powerful and robust OpenSTEP OS.This also brought Jobs back into the company. He quickly assumed control and began to turn the Mac platform around. Jobs trimmed the bloat from the product line and steadily began to focus on releasing stylish computers like the iMac and iBook for consumers and powerhouses for the Mac's creative professional base like the PowerBook and PowerMac lines.iMac, Apple's Flagship MacSince then, the Mac has become known as a stylish computer for the image conscious, as well as a great tool for artists, writers, film editors and so on. Since approximately halfway through the first decade of the 21st Century, Apple has begun to play up the Mac as a games platform, something for which it had developed a reputation for being poor at. This took several forms, most visibly the appearance of EA at an Apple event to promote the fact that they were bringing a number of games to the platform.Despite the perception of the Mac as a second-rate games platform (by comparison to the dominant Windows PC), it has played host to a number of popular exclusives, most notably much of Bungie's earlier games (before the Microsoft buyout) catalog. In fact, Bungie's Halo, a huge hit for the Xbox, was originally a Mac exclusive, built on OpenGL. The game later found its way onto Mac as a port of the PC release.On April 5, 2006 Apple released a beta version of a new piece of software called Boot Camp. Due to the recent change in architecture - PowerPC to Intel - Mac and Windows computers were now more similar than ever. Boot Camp embraced this by allowing the user to install Windows on a Mac. Windows XP - and later Windows Vista and 7 - now ran natively on Macintosh computers, making gaming on Mac's easier than ever.With the release of Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), Boot Camp comes pre-installed on all Mac's and is thus officially supported by Apple. Although many Mac users are unwilling to install Windows on their computer, Boot Camp still offers Mac users something they've never had before - the ability to run any PC game 100% natively.On March 8th, 2010, Valve announced that it would begin a new Steam program for the Mac. Under this new system, Valve games would be able to run natively on the Mac, and 3rd parties would be able to release a Mac version of their game on Steam. Also announced is a program called Steam Play, where players who buy the Mac version of a game will also be able to download the PC version of the same game free of charge. Steam for Mac was released on May 12, 2010.Mimicking their strategy with the iOS platform, Apple has recently added an integrated App Store to the Mac OS. Users can purchase Applications in the same way as on iOS. Apps are then downloaded to a user's system and the App Store App itself keeps track of updates for these Apps. In addition, once an App is purchased, users are free to install it on any other Mac computer by logging into the Mac App Store with the same Apple Account.This service, just like on iOS, extends to games and already a number of Publishers have made classic and more recent titles available for purchase on the Mac App Store. These games range from recent and current hits to old favourites, to popular indie games like the Penny Arcade Adventures episodes and also ports of existing iOS games like Angry Birds.",

    "description": "PSP revisions from top to bottom: The 1000, 2000, 3000, and Go models.The PlayStation Portable (or PSP) was released March 24, 2005 and marked Sony's first entry into the handheld gaming market.In late 2007, the PSP was upgraded with a new hardware variation known by the model number PSP-2000.On August 20, 2008, at the Leipzig Games Convention, Sony announced a new revision of the PSP, the PSP-3000.On June 2, 2009, at E3 in Los Angeles, Sony announced the PSPgo, which removed the UMD drive and instead was the first dedicated gaming handheld to be completely dependent on downloaded software.In August, 2011, at Gamescom in Cologne, Sony announced the budget priced PSP-E1000 for PAL regions, which retained a UMD drive but removed network support. This would be the last revision of the PSP.PSP 1000 (bottom) vs. Slim (top)During the E3 conference of 2007, Sony released several details about the PSP's first hardware revision. The model number is PSP-2000, then commonly referred to as the PSP Slim. The Slim replaced the original (or ''phat'') PSP on the market and had significant hardware changes. The amount of RAM in the PSP-2000 was doubled from 32 megabytes to 64 megabytes. This added RAM was primarily used to decrease UMD load times, and to improve the memory limit when browsing web pages. The Slim's battery was manufactured to supply the same amount of playtime as the Phat battery while attaining a smaller form factor. The WLAN switch was relocated to the top of the device, and the UMD drive now required the user to open it manually, as opposed to the spring-loaded version in the PSP-1000 that was activated using a switch.The PSP Slim was released in September of 2007.PSP Slim vs. PSP-3000Sony officially announced the PSP-3000 at the 2008 Leipzig Games Convention. Improvements over the PSP-2000 included a built in mic and an improved LCD screen. The new screen features twice the color gamut, five times the contrast ratio, and a response time that is twice as fast as the PSP-2000's LCD screen. It also features a new anti-reflective technology for improved viewing of the LCD screen in outdoor areas.The PSP-3000 was released in Japan, Europe and North America in October.PSP GO in the FleshDuring E3 2009, Sony revealed the PSPgo, (or PSP Go) the lightest and most physically compact PSP model. This portability is achieved using a slide-out form factor, a smaller screen (3.8 inch screen as opposed to the 4.3 inches on all other models), and the removal of the UMD drive, limiting the system to digitally downloaded games only. Under the hood, PSPgo is identical to other PSP models, with the same capabilities and OS, while also adding 16GB internal flash memory and PS3 controller support . However, the lack of UMD drive, which physically prevents it from playing disc-based games, resulted in the PSP Go being a complete commercial failure.The 16GB internal storage space can be expanded by the use of Sony's proprietary M2 Memory Stick, unlike the other models of PSP, which use the Memory Stick ProDUO. The PSPgo existed alongside the PSP-3000 when it launched on October 1st, 2009, and unlike other PSP revisions was not intended by Sony to be a replacement for existing models.The device proved unpopular with many gamers for various reasons, most notably the fact that PSP game discs could not be played on the PSPgo. Even if you own a game on disc, in order to play it you would have to repurchase and download the game from PSN, often at a marked up price. To make matters worse, certain PSP titles were never made available for digital download at all, making the PSPgo unattractive even to gamers who did not yet own a PSP.Other issues include the fact that PSN games tend to be overpriced, the slow download speeds on PSP systems in general, new games being listed incorrectly in PSN store, the fact that some games suffering from glitches not found in their UMD counterparts, and poor customer service.PSP-E1000Announced at Gamescom 2011, the PSP-E1000 is a budget-priced PSP available only in PAL territories. Reversing course from the PSPgo, the PSP-E1000 includes a UMD drive, but does not include any network capabilities whatsoever. Slightly larger and heavier than the PSP-3000, the PSP-E1000 has a charcoal black plastic matte body similar to the slim PS3 redesign. The layout is fairly similar to the original PSP, however it moves the system buttons to a single row below the screen which is flush with the case itself. To save on costs, the PSP-E1000 removed WiFi and has only one speaker instead of two. Despite the lack of wireless connectivity, PSN content could still be accessed by connecting the PSP-E1000 to a Playstation 3, or to a PC via USB and using Sony's Media Go software.The PSP-E100 launched at a cost of €99.99 or £85. Shown off at E3 2004, the portable was highly anticipated and thought of by many at the time to be superior to the Nintendo DS which was launching around the same time.However, leadIng up to launch whispers of long load times and a short battery life began appearing online. These criticisms were true and it was something that would haunt the system for a majority of it's life.Another hamper to the system was a divided perspective of the handheld market. During its first few years, the PSP would often get ports or sequels of console games that many felt were ill-suited for the portable market. By 2006 and continuing into 2007, several of these PSP titles were ported to Playstation 2.Rampant piracy was also an issue for third parties. The PSP was easily hackable and guides on how to bypass the system's security were easily available on the web. Sony attempted through several firmware updates to make hacking the system more difficult but the wheels were already in motion.By mid-2008 the once promising handheld's library looked barren with few games being released apart from ports. Sony would try in 2009 to give the system one last serious push with titles like Rockband Unplugged and Motorstorm Arctic Edge but at that point much of the damage had already been done.Despite this the PSP is still remembered for its best games and for being the most successful dedicated gaming handheld that wasn't made by Nintendo. The system is also known among gamers for its homebrew scene which Sony desperately tried to put a lid on.In Japan, the PSP continued to be phenomenally successful well past the launch date of the Playstation Vita, (the PSP's successor) and even outselling the Nintendo DS and 3DS for a period of time.Armored Core: Formula FrontMahjong FightMinna no Golf PortableLuminesRidge RacersVampire Chronicle: The Chaos TowerApe Escape: On the LooseDarkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos TowerDynasty WarriorsGretzky NHLLuminesMetal Gear AcidNBANeed for Speed Underground: RivalsNFL Street 2 UnleashedRidge RacerSpider-Man 2Tiger Woods PGA TourTony Hawk's Underground 2 RemixTwisted Metal: Head-OnUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the BladeWipeout PureWorld Tour SoccerDead to Rights ReckoningMidnight Club 3: DUB EditionMVP BaseballSmart BombHot Shots Golf: Open TeeNBA Street ShowdownRengoku: Tower of PurgatoryFIFA SoccerATV Offroad Fury : Blazin' TrailsMLBMercuryApe AcademyArcher Maclean's MercuryColin McRae Rally 2005Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos TowerDynasty WarriorsEverybody's Golf PortableFired UpKao ChallengersLuminesMediEvil ResurrectionMetal Gear AcidMidnight Club 3: DUB EditionNeed for Speed Underground: RivalsRidge RacerSmart BombSpider-Man 2TOCA Race Driver 2Tony Hawks Underground 2 RemixUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the BladeVirtua Tennis: World TourWipeout PureWorld Snooker Championship 2005World Tour Soccer: Challenge EditionWorld Rally Championship'Universal Media Discs' are used by the PSP for games and movies. They are small circular discs in a plastic casing. All PSP models except the PSPgo support this format, and various games include firmware updates for the PSP on their disc.Some movies available on UMD are now included on Blu-Ray releases. The user can download a PSP version of the film from their PS3 to the PSP or PSPgo. Some examples are Godzilla and The Ugly Truth.Copies of Lumines featured an older firmware update which many users bought and installed to unlock their PSP. At the time this firmware update left the PSP easier to unlock. More recent firmware updates make this harder to do.The PSP plays most MP3 and AVC music files. The PSP's video playback options are far more limited, however. The PSP can play movie downloads and rentals from the Playstation Video store, but playing your own movies generally requires a file converter as the PSP does not support the vast majority of movie files.Videos, games, and music can all be managed on the PSP by connecting it to your PC via a USB cable. Sony also distributes free software named Media Go, which allows users to download PSN content from their PC.Each PSP requires a Memory Stick Pro Duo, which is a proprietary memory stick format created by Sony. The memory stick is typically sold separately. The PSP was very well known for it's Custom Firmware scene. By opening up the battery and cutting a part of it, you could install Custom Firmware which allowed users to run unsigned software, which allowed ISOs of PSP games, emulators, and homebrew. It was later made even easier, because by some point you could just do it from files on the Memory Stick. Throughout the PSP's life, Sony tried to put a lid on this and kept updating the firmware, plugging up exploits each time, which made them infamous in the Homebrew scene. Now that the PSP has been discontinued, it's very easy to mod them, even on hardware revisions that were unmoddable during a good portion of their life, including the PSP go.",

    "description": "The PlayStation 2The PlayStation 2 was released on March 4th 2000 in Japan, October 26th 2000 in North America, November 24th 2000 in Europe and November 30th 2000 in Australia. At its core, the PlayStation 2 is powered by a 128-bit CPU co-developed with Toshiba known as the \"Emotion Engine,\" the \"Graphics Synthesizer\" chip, a 24x speed CD-ROM (4x DVD drive, 2 proprietary controller ports, 2 proprietary memory card slots, DEV9 expansion bay for a network adapter, and 2 USB 1.1 ports.The PS2 initially sold well partly on the basis of the strength of the PlayStation brand and the console's backward compatibility with original PlayStation titles. It sold over 980,000 units by March 5th 2000, one day after launch in Japan. The launch of the PlayStation 2 was not without its setbacks. Manufacturing delays pushed back the original launch day of the PlayStation 2 to fall in North America, and a number of early PlayStation 2 units suffered from disk read errors which subsequently prompted a class action lawsuit against Sony. Sony agreed to provide free repair or replacement for the faulty consoles and continued to do so until February 2005.At the time, many in the gaming industry predicted a close match up between the PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox, and Nintendo's GameCube. Sega's Dreamcast was released a full 16 months before the PlayStation 2, but failed to gain enough momentum and Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in March of 2001 to turn its attention to software publishing. The prediction, however, was never fulfilled as the release of several blockbuster games during the 2001 holiday season maintained sales momentum and held off the PlayStation 2's rivals.On December 28th, 2012, Sony confirmed that the PlayStation 2 console had been discontinued in Japan. A week later, Sony confirmed that manufacture of the console had been discontinued worldwide, marking almost 13 years of production for the console. At 150 million units sold worldwide, it is the best-selling console ever.A-Train 6DrumManiaEternal RingKakinoki Shogi IVKessenMorita ShogiRidge Racer VStepping SelectionStreet Fighter EX3Armored Core 2Dead or Alive 2: HardcoreDynasty Warriors 2ESPN International Track and FieldESPN X-Games SnowboardingEternal RingEvergraceFantavisionGungriffon BlazeKessenMadden NFL 2001Midnight ClubMoto GPNHL 2001OrphenQ-Ball Billiards MasterReady 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2Ridge Racer VSilent ScopeSmuggler's RunSSXStreet Fighter EX3SummonerSwing Away GolfTekken TAG TournamentTimeSplittersUnreal TournamentWild Wild RacingX-SquadAqua AquaBust A Move 4Donald Duck Quack AttackESPN International Track and FieldESPN X-Games SnowboardingF1 Racing ChampionshipFantavisionFIFA 2001Gradius III & IVInternational Superstar Soccer 2000Madden NFL 2001Midnight ClubOrphenRayman RevolutionRC Revenge ProReady 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2Ridge Racer VSilent ScopeSmuggler's RunSSXSummonerSwing Away GolfTekken TAG TournamentTimeSplittersTheme Park WorldWild Wild RacingX-SquadBefore the launch of Microsoft's online capable Xbox, Sony placed little emphasis on online gaming during the PlayStation 2's early years. In 2002 however, Sony began advertising heavily on several online first party titles, such as SOCOM: US Navy Seals, to compete with Microsoft. Although late, and despite the fact that Sony required developers pick up the responsibility of providing servers, online gaming was one of the major selling points of the PlayStation 2. The original PlayStation 2 consoles did not have an integrated network adapter, requiring the user to purchase the unit separately. The launch of the PlayStation 2 Slim model saw the network adapter built into the console.PS2 SlimIn September 2004, in time for the launch of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Sony unveiled its major hardware revision: a smaller, thinner and quieter PlayStation 2 that included a built-in Ethernet port. It didn't contain the 3.5\" expansion bay, removing support for the internal hard disk drive. Similar to the GameCube, early models lacked an internal power supply, and had a modified multi-tap expansion. Current PlayStation 2 Slims no longer require an external power supply. The removal of the expansion bay has been criticized as a limitation due to the existence of titles such as Final Fantasy XI, which require the use of the HDD. The PlayStation 2 Slim model was first released in black, however today the slimline model can be found in silver, white, and pink in North America.The Sony PSX (not to be confused with the PlayStation) is a consumer device that can be used as a digital video recorder, DVD burner, and PS2 game player. It also had built in video, photo, and audio editing software. The device, which has only released in Japan, was poorly received, with some major features absent from the first revisions of the hardware. Despite major price drops on the device, sales were very weak in Japan. It is still notable for introduction of the popular XMB interface, now used in Sony's PSP, PlayStation 3, and Bravia TVs.Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - 17.33 MillionGran Turismo 3: A-Spec - 14.89 MillionGran Turismo 4 - 10.76 MillionGrand Theft Auto: Vice City - 9.61 MillionGrand Theft Auto III - 7.9 MillionMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty - 7 MillionFinal Fantasy X - 6.6 MillionKingdom Hearts - 5.9 Million ShippedFinal Fantasy XII - 5.2 Million ShippedDragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King - 4.78 Million ShippedCPU: 128 Bit \"Emotion Engine\"System Clock: 300 MHzSystem Memory: 32 MB Direct RambusMemory Bus Bandwidth: 3.2 GB per secondCo-Processor: FPU (Floating Point Multiply Accumulator x 1, Floating Point Divider x 1)Vector Units: VU0 and VU1 (Floating Point Multiply Accumulator x 9, Floating Point Divider x 1)Floating Point Performance: 6.2 GFLOPSCompressed Image Decoder: MPEG2Number of voices: ADPCM: 48 channel on SPU2 plus definable by softwareSampling Frequency: 44.1 KHz or 48 KHz (selectable)CPU Core: Current PlayStation CPUClock Frequency: 33.8 MHz or 37.5 MHz (selectable)Sub Bus: 32 BitInterface Types: IEEE1394, Universal Serial Bus (USB)Communication: via PC-Card PCMCIADisc Media: DVD-ROM (CD-ROM compatible)Clock Frequency: 150MHzDRAM Bus bandwidth: 48 GB Per SecondDRAM Bus width: 2560 bitsPixel Configuration: RGB:Alpha:Z Buffer (24:8:32)Maximum Polygon Rate: 75 Million Polygons Per Second (Theoretical Peak)3D CG Geometric Transformation: 66 million Polygons Per Second (Theoretical Peak) ",

Microsoft also claims that the system will run quieter than previous versions, dubbed \"Whisper quiet\". The new console will retail for $299.99 and began shipping to retailers June 14, 2010. All previous versions of the Xbox 360 have been reduced by 50 dollars.This model was updated in late 2012 to include the pack in game Forza 4 and a download code for Elder scrolls V: Skyrim. AAs an interesting note at the end of their E3 conference Microsoft also announced that all those in attendance would be getting a free new Xbox 360 S (later received in the mail).On November 16, 2010 Microsoft release a bundle of a standard 250 gigabyte Xbox 360 came with the motion camera system Kinect and a copy of Kinect Adventures. It retailed for $399.99.The 4 gigabyte Xbox 360 \"s\" features 802.11n wi-fi built in and has a matte finish rather than a the glossy finish of the 250 gigabyte model.

The console also comes with a copy of the standard edition of the game.Xbox 360 \"Halo 3\" EditionPrior to the release of Halo 3, Microsoft revealed the Halo 3 Special Edition Xbox 360, with an MSRP of $399.99 USD. The system's specifications were virtually identical to the Xbox 360 Premium at the time. The system, wireless controller, and headset were painted in \"Spartan green and gold,\" and the case sported the Halo 3 logo. The system came with an exclusive Dashboard theme and a Play and Charge Kit for the wireless controller.Xbox 360 RE5 EditonOn February 4, 2009 before the launch of Resident Evil 5, Microsoft announced the Resident Evil Limited Edition of the Xbox 360. The bundle featured a red Xbox 360, a red wireless gamepad, a black headset, 120GB hard drive, a copy of Resident Evil 5, a download code for Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, and a code for an exclusive theme.Modern Warfare 2 EditionThe Modern Warfare 2 Special Edition was a Limited Edition release of the Elite version of the console with a few upgraded features. With an MSRP of $399.99 USD the console was released in conjunction with Modern Warfare 2 on November 10th, 2009. This Limited Edition was packaged with a 250 GB hard drive, a copy of Modern Warfare 2, two black wireless controllers, a black headset, and a modified case design. Microsoft worked exclusively with Infinity Ward's art designers to produce a unique black and gray military styled case that matches Modern Warfare 2.The Xbox 360 Premium was identical to the Xbox 360 Pro configuration but contained an older CPU architecture. Manufacturing for the Premium branded units ceased in August 2007.Xbox 360 CoreThe Xbox 360 Core was the barebones 360 model that carried an MSRP of $279.99 and was similar to the current Arcade configuration. It included a wired controller, had no HDMI port, and did not include any kind of storage. The Xbox 360 Core was often seen as a misstep because its production meant that developers could not take advantage of the features Xbox 360 HDD in their games, since not all users would have one. It's main benefit to Microsoft was in marketing the platform when it was launched, as they were able to state that consumers could buy an Xbox 360 for \"under $300,\" even though the more desirable Xbox 360 Premium was close to $400 USD at the time.Xbox 360 ProThe Xbox 360 Pro, available in the \"Go Pro\" bundle, had an MSRP of $249.99 USD and replaced the Xbox 360 Premium SKU. Included in the bundle were all the features found in the Xbox 360 Arcade, as well as a 60 GB hard drive and a hybrid composite/component cable. The pre-loaded, detachable 60GB hard drive came with game demos, video clips and a free Live Arcade game: Hexic HD. The hard drive allowed for the storage of downloaded content, backwards compatibility with original Xbox games, and storage of game saves. The Xbox 360 Pro bundle carried an MSRP of $299.99 USD. Prior to August 2008, the included HDD was only 20GB. For the 2007 holiday shopping season, Microsoft bundled copies of Forza Motorsport 2 and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance with the Xbox 360 Pro. In 2008, the holiday bundle included Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda. In 2009, reduced the price of the Xbox 360 Elite to $299.99, and phased out the Xbox 360 Pro.An entry level Xbox 360 that replaced the now discontinued Xbox 360 Core. The Xbox 360 Arcade sports a wireless controller, 256 MB memory unit (Which has now been replaced with an internal 256mb chip in the 'Jasper' version of consoles), composite AV cable, HDMI 1.2 output, and 5 Xbox Live Arcade titles: Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, Pac-Man Championship Edition, and Uno on a single disk. This disc also includes a \"Welcome Video\" and several game trailers/demos. Officially announce on October 22, 2007, the Xbox 360 Arcade has a MSRP of $199.99 USD. Recently Microsoft confirmed that they are now putting internal memory into the Xbox 360 Arcade. This storage will be the same size as the previous external memory units: 256MB. Xbox 360 Arcade systems packaged for the 2008 holiday shopping season are bundled with a copy of Sega Superstars Tennis.Xbox 360 EliteThe Elite is currently the mid-end Xbox 360 configuration carrying an MSRP of $249.99 USD. It has all of the features of the Xbox 360 Pro, but comes with an upgraded 120 GB hard drive and has a matte black finish with matching controller and headset. For the 2008 holiday shopping season, The Elite model came packed with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda. In 2009 there was a bundle which included both Fable 2 and Halo 3. This was followed with a bundle containing Lego Batman and Pure. In 2009, Microsoft dropped the price of the Xbox 360 Elite to $299.99, most likely to match the price of Sony's new PS3 slim carrying the same price. In 2010, Microsoft introduced a redesigned Xbox 360 and reduced the price of the 360 Elite to $249.99.Released with little to no fanfare, the Splinter Cell Conviction bundle is quite similar to its immediate predecessor, the Final Fantasy XIII bundle. It includes a black Xbox 360 Console, a 250GB HDD, two black Xbox 360 controllers, and a copy of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction. Unlike many of the special edition Xbox 360 bundles, this one does not feature any unique artwork or designs on any of the included hardware. It retailed for $399.99 US.The Xbox 360 has a large array of games starting in November 2005. On launch, Microsoft's first party titles included Perfect Dark Zero, Kameo: Elements of Power, and PGR 3. Activision's Call of Duty 2 introduces console gamers to the series and became the biggest game on Xbox Live during launch. Later in 2006, Epic Games released Gears of War, what was considered to be the \"killer app\" of the Xbox 360. Thanks to the game's impressive graphics and multiplayer, the game became a big hit. 2007 would follow many games like Halo 3 (one of the most hyped games of the year), Mass Effect, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which broke many records on Xbox Live when it was released, with its sequel surpassing it. Many other sequels would be released including Fable 2 and Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts within the later years.One key feature to Xbox Live's success is the Xbox Live Arcade games. On launch, the 360 Premium bundle came packaged with Hexic HD, a puzzle game created by Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov. Other launch titles include Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved and Marble Blast Ultra. In the beginning, Microsoft restricted Arcade game sizes to no more than 50 MB big due to the Core model and its memory card. Later, when the 256 MB memory card was released, the game size limit was expanded. Today you're able to get full games online and games can be installed to your hard drive.By and large the Xbox 360 is not compatible with original Xbox games out of the box. Instead Microsoft provided software emulation for selected titles. The emulation is based on games with similar architecture to each other. This means that from a distance the list of compatible titles may look strange with such inclusions as Barbie's Horse Adventure while many best selling or critically acclaimed titles are seemingly ignored.The emulation is not perfect and in a lot of case games feature glitches that were not present in the original version. Glitches can go from minor (slowdown, framerate issues) to sever (some glitches cause games to full on crash) Thirteen games were pulled from the service presumable due to such issue. (Seven of which were later reinstated)Microsoft stopped updating the Xbox emulator in 2007. According to Wikipedia the final total of backwards compatible titles is 476 title making up approximately half of all Xbox games.. The old Xbox 360 DashboardSince launch the main way of interacting with the Xbox 360 has been using the 'Dashboard', a menu system split into sections by 'Blades'; initially the 'Dashboard' consisted of four 'Blades:' Live, Games, Media and Settings; a blade was later added which separated the Xbox Live Marketplace from the Xbox Live 'Blade'. At the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) Microsoft announced it would be completely redesigning the Xbox Dashboard into a more conventional menu system dubbed the New Xbox Experience.The New Xbox Experience (NXE) is designed to be more user friendly and to be expandable as new content is added, it takes several design cues from the likes of Apple and Nintendo, and introduces several new features such as Avatars and Live Party. The New Xbox Experience was released on November 19, 2008.The New Xbox ExperienceAvatars: A 3D representation of the user, replaces the current Gamercard; however Microsoft assure gamers they can still use their old Gamercard.Live Party: A group of up to 8 people, allows users to voice chat independent of which game they are each playing.Play From Drive: Allows players to copy disc content over to the HDD in order to cut down load times and DVD drive noise. The disc of the game played from the HDD is still required to be in the DVD drive.Deleting Zero-Point games: The ability to delete games with no achievements unlocked has become possible, so that players may improve their ratio of possible achievements to ones gained.Netflix: The Xbox 360 gained the ability to stream movies from Netfilx to view on your TV. This feature is only available to gold members and requires a Netflix paid account.The new Xbox 360 Guide (accessible through the Xbox button on the controller) will mimic the interface of the \"Blade\" dashboard system. It's accessible in all Xbox 360 games to manage messages/invites, create parties, view player statistics, et cetera.The NXE update was distributed in the fall of 2008, and took 128 Mb of space to install. Those not meeting this requirement (The Arcade and Core SKUs not having hard drives) were given a free memory unit (512MB) by Microsoft or the option to buy a 20GB Hard Drive at $20.At CES 2009 Microsoft's Robby Bach announced Xbox Live Primetime. Primetime was the first channel on Xbox Live to use scheduled programming at specific time so you can find friends & experience live events. One of the first games to run in Primetime was 1 VS 100, which has since been discontinued. On November 17, 2009, Microsoft released another new update for the Xbox 360. With this new update, Microsoft made available custom hubs for Facebook and Twitter, along with added features like posting pictures of your games on your Facebook page. Other features include Last.fm, Zune HD, and accessing news stations like MSNBC.There are a number of criticism that are often leveraged against the Xbox 360, the main one being unreliable hardware quality; however, excessive DVD drive noise and a confusing amount of hardware configurations are also targeted by critics of the system.Red Ring of DeathThe Xbox 360 has gained a reputation for a high failure rate, sometimes rumored to be as high as 30% although Microsoft have denied the failure rate is that high; they have not released an official failure rate. The most common hardware failure is the General Hardware Failure, denoted by the bottom two and upper right quadrant of the Ring of Light flashing red; leading to the failure being dubbed the ' Red Ring of Death'. This failure renders the console unable to boot or 'bricked' and the only official course of action for the consumer being to call Xbox support to ship the console back to Microsoft where it is either repaired or replaced. While there is no official course of action on fixing the Red Ring of Death there are some unofficial solutions to try. The most popular is called the \"towel trick\" in which you take everything off of your Xbox 360, your hard-drive, A/V cables, etc. The only thing you want plugged in is the power supply. Now you wrap it in three (3) large towels (the ones you would use to dry yourself off after a shower) and turn it on. Let it sit running for 20-30 minutes, turn it off, and let it cool off for another 15. Then turn it on and it should work. *Note this is not a permanent solution.*No official reason has been given by Microsoft as to why this error is so common place, however most speculation points towards insufficient cooling around the GPU leading to a warping of the motherboard. Microsoft has taken steps to solve this problem by adding an additional heat sink to the GPU in later units and units returned from repair. These changes were included in a chipset refresh codenamed 'Falcon' which also includes a 65nm CPU to further reduce heat. An as yet unreleased chip set refresh, codenamed 'Jasper,' will introduce a 65nm GPU and is hoped to solve the 'Red Ring of Death' problem.As well as these hardware revisions Microsoft has increased the Xbox 360 warranty to 3 years, however this is only to cover the 'Red Ring of Death' all other hardware problems are only covered for 1 year; this was reported to have cost Microsoft $1 billion.Note: the new \"XBOX 360 'S'\" does not feature the red LEDs behind the power button. Microsoft removed this particular error message because of the bad connotations associated with this.The DVD Drive is often the target of criticism, mostly for the excessive noise produced and an apparent tendency for scratching discs. These issues are less apparent in later models of the 360 as Microsoft have replaced the initial DVD drive with a quieter model from BenQ.The Xbox 360's power adapter is significantly larger than similar adapters on previous consoles. This criticism was mostly vocal at the beginning of the Xbox 360's retail life, as Microsoft has reduced the power adapter's size over the life of the console.Initially Xbox Live Arcade games had to come in under the 50 MB file size restriction. While many people felt that that 50MB was too small to create games this limitation allowed 360 owners without the hard drive to enjoy all of the content of XBLA at that time. Over time Microsoft has relaxed restrictions to coincide with the release of larger memory units. Currently the size limit is 2GB and this is a limitation of the backend of service itself rather than an arbitrary limit imposed by Microsoft.",

    "description": "The Nintendo Entertainment System logoThe Nintendo Entertainment System (often abbreviated as \"NES,\" colloquially referred to as simply \"Nintendo,\" and dubbed as the \"Control Deck\" on boxes and in documentation), also known as the Famicom, was Nintendo's second attempt to attract home consumers, following the modest success of the Color TV Game in Japan.In Japan and many other Asian countries, the NES was known as the Family Computer (or as it came to be later known, the Famicom); in some Asian countries, it was known as the Tata Famicom. It released in Japan in July 15, 1983, on the same day as Sega's SG-1000, which it beat with its technical superiority and stronger software library. The Famicom offered unrivalled technical power in its time for the lowest possible price, selling over 1.4 million units in its first year and establishing console gaming as a mainstream market in Japan, a country that was previously dominated by arcades and home computers (such as the PC-88, PC-98, FM-7, X1, and MSX).The 8-bit video game console was released by Nintendo as the NES in North America, Europe and Australia in 1985. After the North American video game market crash of 1983, the NES was the perfect revitalization. It went on to become the best-selling video game console of all time (up until the PlayStation). Some of the Hollywood stars at the time who owned the NES at the time included Michael J. Fox, Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, and Tom Cruise.The NES introduced many conventions that have become standard, including game controller layout, D-pad, third-party software licensing, and the business strategy of selling hardware at a loss and profiting from licensed software.A boxed NES Control Deck.After the success of the arcade game in the 1980s, Nintendo looked to Masayuki Uemura to design a cartridge-based home console. It was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983. Three launch titles were available: Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. At first, the console was prone to crashes (due to a bad chip set). After a re-release with a new motherboard, the Famicom became incredibly popular.In an effort to enter the North American market, Nintendo negotiated with Atari to release the Famicom as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System, but the deal didn't get off the ground. In June of 1985, Nintendo unveiled the North American version of the Famicom; the NES. On October 18, 1985, the NES was released, along with eighteen launch titles. Two boxed sets were released, the Deluxe Set (console, R.O.B., Zapper, two controllers, Duck Hunt, and Gyromite) and the Control Deck (console, two controllers and Super Mario Bros.).Nintendo had a hard time getting the NES sold, because most consumers thought video games were over with. They realized this and started marketing the NES as a toy instead of a video game. They packed in a light gun and a robot with the console and people started to pay attention. In December of 1985 Nintendo went to toy stores around New York City to try and sell the NES and said if the consoles don't sell they will buy them back. This gave Nintendo a foothold but they still needed to get the NES into the hands of more people.They contacted Worlds of Wonder, a toy company who made the two most popular toys in 1985, Lazer Tag and Teddy Ruxpin, and said if they can get Nintendo into the big department stores their toys are in they can have a percentage of Nintendo's sales. Worlds of Wonder agreed to this deal, so whenever a store called and wanted to order a toy, they would require that store to order 500 NES consoles. This is how Nintendo first got into the American market.The NES was an enormous success in Japan and North America, dominating the competition in both regions. In comparison to its considerable success in Japan and North America, however, the NES had much less success in Europe and South America, with Sega's Master System being significantly more successful than the NES in these regions.

Nintendo had a veritable monopoly on the market at the time, so they encouraged developers to make games for their console. But, developers had to sign a contract stating they would only develop games for the NES. Also, a chip was instituted into the NES called the 10NES. If this same chip was not found in the cartridge, the game wouldn't load. Eventually, however, these business practices were ultimately outlawed.Despite Nintendo's efforts, unlicensed games were still created for the system. Designers found ways to bypass the 10NES chip. One such way was to short circuit the chip, temporarily ceasing its function. However, Atari Games created unlicensed software for the NES under the name Tengen. Tengen didn't want to be held liable for short-circuiting and possibly damaging the NES, so they devised a chip (nicknamed Rabbit) that disabled the 10NES chip. It was later discovered that their patent was acquired illegally, and thus, they were sued by Nintendo and lost.Donkey KongDonkey Kong Jr.Popeye10 Yard FightBalloon FightBaseballClu Clu LandDonkey Kong Jr. MathDuck HuntExcitebikeGolfGyromiteHogan's AlleyIce ClimberKung FuMach RiderPinballStack-UpSuper Mario Bros.TennisWild GunmanWrecking Crew10-Yard FightBaseballClu Clu LandDonkey Kong Jr MathDuck HuntExcitebikeGolfGyromiteHogan's AlleyIce ClimberKung FuMach RiderPinballStack-upSuper Mario Bros.TennisWild GunmanWrecking CrewCPU: 8-bit microprocessor (by Ricoh, based on MOS Technology 6502 core) operating at 1.79MHz on NTSC systems and 1.66MHz on PAL systems.Memory: 2 kB main RAM (random-access memory), 2 kB video RAM, 49,128 bytes ROM (read-only memory)Video: Custom-made picture processing unit (by Ricoh) named RP2C02 (in NTSC models, operates at 5.37 MHz) and RP2C07 (in PAL models, operates at 5.32 MHz)Color palette of 53 colors (48 colors and 5 grays), 25 colors on one scanline64 sprites displayed on the screen simultaneously (sprites can be either 8 x 8 pixels or 8 x 16 pixels)Display resolution is 256 x 240 pixels (effective resolution of 256 x 224 pixels)Audio: Ricoh RP2A03 on NTSC systems and Ricoh RP2A07 on PAL systems.

Known as the top-loader, this version is nearly identical to the original model, but it has several key differences. The main difference, and the reason for its nickname, is the fact that cartridges are loaded into a slot on the top of the console, rather than through a tray at the front. It also sported a different color scheme and controllers, a redesigned logo, and modified circuit boards to improve the video output. NES-101 was known as HVC-101 in Japan, and was released on December 1, 1993.PlayChoice-10Nintendo also released the PlayChoice-10. The PlayChoice-10 was an arcade cabinet that contained full versions of ten NES games. This was to capitalize on the success of arcades at the time, as well as compete with Sega's arcade versions of the Sega Genesis and Sega Master System. In addition to Nintendo's own games, many third party games also appeared on the PlayChoice-10.Japanese FamulatorAfter the release of the NES a lot of companies made emulators for retro gamers. One example is the new release of the NES Emulator\"Famulator\" in Japan created by \"Cyber Gadget\". The Famulator is a slimmer, thinner, and lighter version of the original NES. Although the models look totally different the cartridges fit perfectly and run perfectly. The Famulator was priced 2,980 Japanese Yen, which adds up to roughly 30 American Dollars, creating a cheap and small NES for retro gamers. The Famulator comes with two controllers with the typical A & B buttons but an add on with AA & BB which are just double the speed of the regular A & B buttons. The Famulator also includes the normal cables for connection to a display.Sharp Famicom TwinSharp made their own version of the Famicom, which combines the Famicom and Famicom Disk System in one unit. The system comes in two colors. Red with black highlights and black with red highlights. They later released a Turbo version in black with green highlights and red with blue/grey highlights. The Famicom Twin was licensed by Nintendo and also contains most of the original hardware with few changes.The PolyStation was a unique clone released in China, designed to look like Sony's PlayStation, but emulate the NES's hardware. The PolyStation's packaging also falsely represented the product, showing screenshots from other consoles such as the SNES, the Genesis, or the PlayStation, or describing advanced features that the NES is not capable of doing. The console has appeared under a variety of names, and sometimes even includes packaged pirated games.The Dendy logoOne of the more popular clones of the NES, the Dendy rose to popularity in Eastern Europe in particular due to the fact that an official NES never made it to that region, and importation was expensive. Over two million Dendy consoles sold in Russia by 1996, many for under the equivalent of $50 USD. The Dendy differs slightly from the NES in terms of hardware, containing a slightly different chipset. There were several variations of the Dendy, such as Dendy Classic and Dendy Junior. Cartridges were typically bootleg versions of official games, or even compilations, and were similar in appearance to the Famicom cartridges.",

    "description": "The Sony PlayStation (common abbreviations are PS, PS1, PSone, and PSX) is a video game console that was released by Sony Computer Entertainment, in Japan on December 3, 1994, and in North America on September 9, 1995. The PlayStation was the first of Sony Computer Entertainment's game consoles. The Playstation was the predecessor to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, Playstation Vita, and most recently the PlayStation 4, which was released in 2013.The development of the PlayStation actually began before the 16-bit era. At that time, Nintendo wanted to experiment with the CD-ROM media for use on the Famicom (following the success of NEC's PC Engine CD-ROM² in Japan), but encountered a few problems. Nintendo finally decided to work with Sony, one of the creators of the CD-ROM format (with Phillips) to produce a CD add-on to the Super Nintendo, named the SNES-CD. A contract was signed in 1988, and Sony began work on the product. Initially, the partnership was supposed to be announced at CES 1991, but while reviewing the first contract, Hiroshi Yamauchi found out that Sony would entirely handle every title release on the console. Nintendo then secretly cancelled the deal. At CES 1991, shortly after Sony announced their \"Play Station\" add-on for the SNES, Nintendo announced its cancellation and that they were working to bring Nintendo franchises on Phillips’ own console, the CD-i. This proved to be a bad decision on Nintendo's part as every game that used those properties were poorly received by both gamers and critics.Ken KutaragiKen Kutaragi, president of Sony later dubbed the “The Father of the PlayStation,” was angered by the turn of events. He even declared that they would bury Nintendo. After this, Sony considered abandoning the whole project, which would have lost millions of dollars. Instead, they decided to take everything they learned while developing the console to create their own stand-alone video game system. In 1992, Sony signed a deal that would allow their new console to still be able to play SNES games, with Nintendo maintaining the rights to the game. However, Sony decided to abandon this idea and began reworking their concept for a video game system. They now were aiming for the next-generation of consoles, making the contract they signed with Nintendo irrelevant. Nintendo tried to prevent the release of the PlayStation with a lawsuit in 1991, claiming they essentially owned the name, but this tactic did not work.The PlayStation was originally intended to be a mainly 2D-focused system. However, after Sony designers saw the huge success of Sega's Virtua Fighter (developed by Yu Suzuki and his Sega AM2 team) at Japanese arcades in 1993, they decided to make the PlayStation a mainly 3D-focused system (see here for more details).The final version of the PlayStation took about 6 months to develop. Selling the console to publishers and developers was not an easy task for two reasons. One, Sony had to contend with the success of Nintendo and Sega at that time. Two, the PlayStation was a CD-based video game system, and so far none of them had been successful outside of Japan. Yet, when Sony showed them tech demos of the 3D capabilities of the system, gaming publishers and developers were sold on the console. At E3 1995, the first Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony announced the price point of $299.PS Launch PackagingThe console was first released in Japan, on December 3rd 1994, over 9 months before it would appear officially in the west. This fueled a massive import market in Europe and the US prior to it's official release there. The release date of the console in North America was September 9th 1995, in order to compete with the Sega Saturn and its supposed “Saturnday” September 2nd release. Its launch was accompanied by the advertising campaign “U R Not E” with the E printed in red, symbolizing the word “ready”. Launch titles were:Battle Arena ToshindenESPN Extreme GamesKileak: The DNA ImperativeNBA JAM Tournament EditionPower Serve 3D TennisThe Raiden ProjectRaymanRidge RacerStreet Fighter: The MovieTotal Eclipse TurboThe European release followed soon after, on September 29th, by which time more games were already available for purchase, including the enigmatic Wipeout. A platform exclusive title, that would take center stage in securing the 'cool' image of the Playstation brand.The PlayStation had an interesting pre-order plan; people who reserved the console before its release would receive a compact disc which could be played in any standard Audio-CD player. When the consumer received their PlayStation, putting the compact disc in the console would reveal it was a demo disc; the first in a very long line. While the launch line-up for the PlayStation wasn’t the strongest ever, the following month would prove to be very important with the release of big titles, such as Warhawk, Twisted Metal, and of course, Tekken.Bernie StolarBefore the system was launched, Bernard “Bernie” Stolar was made the first executive vice-president of SCEA. With him, he installed policies for games that were eligible release to the PlayStation in North America: 2D games and RPGs were not allowed. Stolar felt that 2-dimensonal games should be excluded because the console was made especially for 3D gaming, and because of the 16-bit was near its end and 2D gaming was heavily associated with it. Stolar felt that RPGs should not be released in the US because the US audience did not enjoy that type of game, and sales in North America proved this. Stolar would leave SCEA after the first holiday of the system's existence. He moved to Sega and began work on its new-console, the Saturn, with those same policies. Stolar's departure from SCEA opened the door to one of the most important games of the PlayStation era: Final Fantasy VII.Final Fantasy VIIBefore Final Fantasy VII, Square developed every game of the Final Fantasy series for the Nintendo consoles. When Nintendo released the Nintendo 64, Square was skeptical of its cartridge system; cartridges cost more to produce and had less storage space than a CD-Rom. Considering the costs of their new project, Square had to make a hard decision and announced on January 12th, 1996 that they would only develop for Sony consoles from now on. This policy remained in place until the release of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, in 2003. Final Fantasy VII was released in Japan January 31st 1997, and helped the PlayStation achieve mainstream popularity (serving as a killer app), it would impact pop culture in both the United States and Japan. The game also helped RPG's gain mainstream popularity, and inspired many role-playing games released during the following years.PSone Packaging / ScreenOn July 7, 2000, Sony released a new version of its console under the name PSone. The console was 50% smaller than the original PlayStation, and went on to outsell every other system on the market from throughout the rest of the year, including the PlayStation 2, released on October 26th. In fact, the PlayStation became the first video game console to ship 100 million units worldwide. The system was finally discontinued on March 23rd 2006, more than ten years after its launch. In the end, the PlayStation sold 102 million units, with 28 million being from the PSone redesign; thus, judging by sales and units sold, it clearly “won” the fifth generation of video game consoles.Eventually the PSone received a LCD screen add-on, which made the system semi-portable.Original ControllerThe PlayStation controller was the most symmetrical of the game controllers at the time of its release and it still is in the current generation of game consoles. The use of shapes labels is unique to the PlayStation controller with a square, triangle, cross, and circle on the right side of the controller. The left side of the controller has a standard D-pad and on top of the controller is two buttons on the right and left side (L1, L2, R1, R2). After the release of the Dual Analog controller, there were two analog sticks, one for each of the gamer's thumbs.PS DualShock ControllerThe core of the original PlayStation controller design is still used today by the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. The changes to the controller over the 13 years since the original PlayStation launched have been relatively minor. Part way through the life cycle of the PlayStation, Sony introduced the Dual Analog controller, then the DualShock controller. The DualShock controller worked on both PlayStation and PlayStation 2. When the PlayStation 3 launched, the controller became wireless and gained the use of the Sixaxis but lost the vibration function that gamers had become familiar with. This was a result of litigation that Sony faced over the vibration technology. Later, with the legal troubles settled, Sony released the DualShock 3 that reintroduced the vibration function.A few years after the PlayStation was released, Sony released the PocketStation, a portable accessory that had an infared port to transfer game saves and info to other PocketStations. It could also download features for PS1 games that weren't featured on the console version.ProcessorR3000A 32-bit RISC at 33.8MHzOperation Cycle: 30 MIPSBandwidth Bus: 123MBInstructional Cache: 4KBSRAM Data Cache: 1KBCo ProcessorsGeometry Transformation EngineOperation Cycle: 66 MIPS180,000 Texture Mapped Polygons Per-Second360,000 Flat-Shaded Polygons Per-SecondData Decompression EngineOperation Cycle 80 MIPSMJEPG and H. 261 File DecodingDirect CPU Bus ConnectionNote: The Data Decompression Engine is mainly used to cut back on game loading times.GraphicsMaximum Colors: 16.7 Million (Tru-Color)Maximum Sprites: 40002D Scaling and Rotation3D Texture Mapping and ShadingTransparency and FadingScreen Resolution: 256 x 224 - 640 x 480Possible AV Outputs: Composite, S-Video, Component (RGB)SoundCustom Sound Processing Unit24 Channel ADPCMSample Rate 44.1KHzMemoryMain Memory: 2MBVideo Memory: 1MBSound Memory: 512KOperating System Memory: 512KCD Rom Cache Memory: 32KCD-RomXA Mode 2 CapableCD-DA Capable (allows Audio CD Playback)2x Functioning SpeedGran TurismoThe following are the top 10 best selling games for the Playstation that have sold or shipped at least one million copies.Gran Turismo (10.85 million)Final Fantasy VII (10 million)Gran Turismo 2 (9.37 million)Final Fantasy VIII (8.15 million)Tomb Raider II (8 million)Metal Gear Solid (7 million)Tomb Raider (7 million)Crash Bandicoot (6.8 million)Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped (5.7 million)Final Fantasy IX (5.30 million)",

    "description": "The Nintendo GameCube and its logoThe Nintendo GameCube is Nintendo's successor to the Nintendo 64 and predecessor to the Nintendo Wii. The GameCube was released in Japan on September 14, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002.The GameCube sold a total of 21.74 million units worldwide, coming in third place in the so-called \"console war\" slightly behind Microsoft's Xbox, but far behind Sony's PlayStation 2. The console is officially abbreviated to the acronym \"GCN\" (\"GameCube by Nintendo\").A version of the GameCube with DVD playback capability was released by Panasonic, but the \"Panasonic Q Edition\" GameCubes weren't available outside of Japan.The Panasonic Q Gamecube was released only in Japan.The GameCube also saw a fair share of games, although its most popular games were first-party; Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, F-Zero GX, and Animal Crossing, to name a few. Games released only on the GameCube at the time of release have a triangle in the upper left corner that says \"Only For,\" implicating that the game was only available on the GameCube. The final \"major release\" on the GameCube was also first-party, with The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess being one of the most highly-anticipated titles in the console's run, though it is more well known for the version that was ported to the Wii.As games were no longer on cartridges Nintendo released a series of memory cards where players would save their progress. Memory cards are available in 59 block (of which several were packaged with games including Animal Crossing), a 256 block, and a 1024 block versions.The first advertising campaign for the Nintendo GameCube was simply a rotating cube that would morph into the GameCube logo. A voice would then whisper, \"GameCube.\" This was usually shown at the end of a commercial for a GameCube game.A wallpaper for the \"Who Are You?\" campaign.Another well known advertising campaign was the \"Who Are You?\" advertising campaign. This was used to market a wide variety of Nintendo games. The \"Who Are You?\" logo was graffiti lettering. Most of the commercials and print ads were games developed or published by Nintendo, but some third-party developers were able to use the campaign as well. The idea behind the campaign was that players were the character that they played, with print ads showing pieces of the main character taped onto a photograph of a person (e.g. the helmet of Samus Aran taped onto a ballerina to promote Metroid Prime).There was a distinct difference in the way Nintendo of Japan marketed the GameCube and how it was marketed in western markets. Although in western markets, the GameCube was advertised as a console for experienced gamers; in Japan, it was marketed to appeal to younger and newer players, as a way of gaining back the child audience they lost to their competitors in the previous console cycle. However, it failed, and the GameCube was a commercial flop in Japan. However, due to being marketed to a different audience outside Japan, the GameCube became a very successful console in other countries.Due to pressures from developers, the GameCube was Nintendo's first console to introduce a disc medium instead of cartridges, the games were recorded on mini DVDs. The disc can hold 1.5 gigabytes of data - 190 times more than what an N64 game cartridge can hold. Technologically speaking, the GameCube was more powerful than the PS2 at about half the size of the Xbox.The GameCube's hardware used techniques to remain small and powerful.Like Nintendo's previous console, the Nintendo 64, and many of the company's handheld consoles, the GameCube was released in a variety of colours. The two most common colours were Indigo and Jet Black (Indigo being the default color). Later, a Platinum color scheme was released and marketed as limited edition. \"Orange Spice\" GameCubes were also made available, but were primarily available in Japan. The GameCube's model numbers (DOL-001 and DOL-101) were a reference to Dolphin, the GameCube's codename. Official accessories and peripherals also had model numbers beginning with DOL.The GameCube has four controller ports.The GameCube allows direct connectivity with Nintendo’s handheld, the Game Boy Advance, via a link cable. Later on, Nintendo released the Game Boy Player which allowed backward compatibility with Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games. There were also some games that supported e-Reader connectivity, allowing players to scan in extra game features. Supported games include Animal Crossing and Pokémon Channel.Although only a few games have online play for the GameCube (such as the Phantasy Star Online franchise), the GameCube offers LAN support that allows eight GameCubes to be connected together to play a multiplayer game. Using this, fans created unofficial online services for the GameCube, such as Warp Pipe, that used LAN technology for online play.A standard GameCube controllerThe inputs on a GameCube controller consist of a large, green A-button, a small, red B-button, two gray X- and Y- buttons, two analog sticks (with the larger being gray and simply called \"the analogue stick\" and the smaller being yellow and called \"the C-stick\", in reference to the C-buttons on the N64 controller), a D-pad, two shoulder buttons, and a purple Z-button on top of the controller next to the right shoulder button. Some Wii games support the use of the GameCube controller (this is taken advantage of in Virtual Console and WiiWare games as well).The wireless version of the controller was called the Wavebird. It allowed players to play from up to 20 feet away. It had the same button layout than the original controller except for an on and off button and a bulkier feel. The controller came with a wireless receiver. To play, the player had to tune his controller to one of the 16 radio channels that the little wheel at the bottom of the controller offered. Then, he had to put the same channel number on the receiver, plug the receiver into the GameCube's controller socket, turn on his controller and a light on the receiver would tell the player that it was receiving a signal. The controller worked with two AA batteries and in order to conserve battery life, rumble is not included. It was released in summer of 2002 for the price of 34.95 dollars.The GameCube unmasked435 MHz IBM Gekko PowerPC CPUPowerPC 750CXe based core180 nm IBM copper-wire process50 new vector instructions32-bit ALU 64-bit FPU, usable as 2x32-bit SIMDFPU:1.9Gflops64-bit enhanced PowerPC 60x front side bus to GPU/chipset, 162 MHz clock, 1.3 GB/s peak bandwidth64 KiB L1 cache (32 KiB I/32 KiB D), 8-way associative, 256 KiB on-die L2 cache, 2-way associative1125 DMIPS (dhrystone 2.1)43 MB total non-unified RAM24 MB MoSys 1T-SRAM main system RAM, 324 MHz, 64-bit bus, 2.7 GB/s bandwidth3 MB embedded 1T-SRAMSplit into 1 MB texture buffer and 2 MB frame buffer10.4 GB/s texture bandwidth (peak), 7.6 GB/s frame buffer bandwidth (peak), about 6.2 ns latency16 MB DRAM used as buffer for DVD drive and audio, 81 MHz, 8-bit bus, 81 MB/s bandwidth4 controller ports, 2 memory card slotsMultiAV analog audiovisual port: interlaced YPbPr (composite, Y/C() and RGB video, stereophonic analog audioDigital audiovisual port: digital interlaced or progressive scan YCBCR video, stereophonic I²S soundResolutions: 480i, 576i, 480pHigh-speed Serial Ports: 2High-speed Parallel Ports: 1Power supply output: DC12 volts x 3.25 amperesPhysical measurements: 110 mm (H) x 150 mm (W) x 161 mm (D); [4.3\"(h) x 5.9\"(W) x 6.3\"(D)]162 MHz \"Flipper\" LSI, 180 nm NEC eDRAM-compatible process, Co-developed by Nintendo and ArtX8Gflops4 pixel pipelines with 1 texture unit eachTEV \"Texture EnVironment\" engineFixed-function hardware transform and lighting (T&L), 12 million polygons/s in-game648 megapixels/s (162 MHz x 4 pipelines), 648 megatexels/s (648 MPx 1 texture units) (peak)Peak triangle performance: 20,250,000 32pixel triangles/s raw and with 1 texture and lit337,500 triangles a frame at 60fps675,000 triangles a frame at 30fps8 texture layers per pass, texture compression, full scene anti-aliasing8 simultaneous hardware lightBilinear, trilinear, and anisotrophic texture filteringMulti-texturing, bump mapping, reflection mapping, 24-bit z-buffer24-bit RGB / 32-bit RGBA color depth720 x 480 interlaced or progressive scanIntegrated audio processor: Custom 81 MHz Macronix DSPInstruction Memory: 8 KiB RAM, 8 KiB ROMData Memory: 8 KiB RAM, 4 KiB ROM64 channels 16-bit 48 kHz ADPCMDolby Pro Logic II encoded within stereophonic outputMatsushita (2.000 MB/s-3.125 MB/s) CAV mini-DVD-like 8 cm optical disk, average access time: 128 ms; capacity: 1.5 GBMemory cards of 59 blocks (4Mbit), 256 blocks (16 Mbit), 1024 blocks (64 Mbit), and 2043 (128Mbit) blocks.Luigi's MansionSuper Monkey BallWave Race: Blue StormAll Star Baseball 2002Batman VengeanceCrazy TaxiDave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2Disney's Tarzan UntamedLuigi's MansionMadden NFL 2002NHL Hitz 20-02Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue LeaderSuper Monkey BallTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3Wave Race: Blue StormBatman VengeanceBloody Roar: Primal FuryBurnoutCel DamageCrazy TaxiDave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2Donald Duck Quack AttackESPN International Winter SportsDisney's Tarzan FreerideFIFA 2002 World CupDrivenLuigi's MansionESPN International Winter Sports 2002Sonic Adventure 2: BattleInternational Superstar Soccer 2Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue LeaderSuper Monkey BallTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3Wave Race: Blue StormXG3: Extreme G RacingStarting the console with no disc in the tray plays the Gamecube menu music.

    "description": "Atari 800.Atari's 8-bit home computer line began with the Atari 400 and Atari 800 which were released in November 1979. The line was later expanded to include the more-powerful Atari XL models and then the XE models. Atari's second cartridge-based console, the Atari 5200, is also based on the same hardware, resulting in many games appearing to be identical across all platforms. The Atari 5200 was followed by the Atari XE Game System which is also based on the Atari 8-bit computers.Atari 800XL.All models use the MOS Technology 6502 CPU, which is the same type of CPU used in the Atari 2600 and the NES. The computers also includes custom chips like the ANTIC display instruction processor, the CTIA/GTIA GPU and the POKEY audio chip. The Atari 400 and 800 were supposed to have 4kB and 8kB RAM respectively, and the names 400 and 800 were originally decided upon because of this, but both models were released with 8kB of RAM since the price of memory had fallen when they were released. The 400 has a membrane keyboard while the 800 has a regular one. The 800 also has two ROM cartridge slots instead of the single slot in the 400. Despite this, the 400 outsold the 800 somewhat.Atari 130XE.In 1982 the 1200XL was released which came with 64kB RAM, a redesigned aluminum case and more custom keys. Some older software was incompatible with the new OS however. A year later the 600XL and 800XL were released which replaced the other models, including the 1200XL. The 600XL had 16kB of RAM and the 800XL had 64kB like the 1200XL did, and used the same general design. A new hardware feature on both these models was the expansion port called the Parallel Bus Interface.After Atari was acquired by Jack Tremiel in 1985, the 8-bit Atari computers once again got a new hardware revision known as the XE series along with the 16-bit Atari ST computer. XE stands for XL-Enhanced. They have a similar case design to the Atari ST line of computers but are otherwise identical on the hardware level to the old 8-bit computers, except for the newer Enhanced Cartridge Interface instead of the Paralell Bus Interface and the fact that the 130XE had 128kB of RAM.XE Game System.In 1987, after seeing the success of the NES, Atari wanted back in on the console market. Theyused hardware from a 65XE to create what we know today as the Atari XE Game System. It included a detachable keyboard, a joystick, a lightgun and the games Bug Hunt and Flight Simulator II. Instead of cassette tapes or diskettes, the XE Game System uses cartridges like most other home consoles at the time. Because the XE Game System was almost the same hardware-wise as the 65XE, a lot of software and hardware for the Atari 8-bit computers are compatible. The system didn't sell as well as hoped, partly because of bad marketing and the fact that new releases for the system were few and far between.In 1992, Atari officially dropped support for their entire 8-bit line of machines.Atari 400's membrane keyboard.400 and 800 (1979) – original machines in beige cases, 400 has a membrane keyboard, 800 has \"full-travel\" keys, two cartridge ports, monitor output, expandable memory slots (up to 48 KB). Later PAL versions uses the 6502C processor.1200XL (1982) – new aluminum and smoked plastic cases, 64 KB of RAM, only two joystick ports. Help key, four function keys. Older, often improperly written software, caused compatibility problems with the new OS.600XL and 800XL (1983) – replacements for the 400, 800 and 1200XL sans function keys. 600XL had 16 KB of memory, PAL versions had a monitor port, 800XL had 64 KB and monitor output. Both have built-in BASIC and an expansion port known as the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI).800XLF – 800XL with Atari FREDDIE chip and BASIC rev. C. Released in Europe only.65XE and 130XE (1985) – A repackaged 800XLF with new cases and keyboards. The 130XE came with 128 KB of RAM and an Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI) instead of a PBI. The U.S./Canadian version of the 65XE has no ECI or PBI.XE Game System (1987) – a game machine in a light beige case, with a detachable full-travel but slightly \"mushy\" keyboard (Atari ST'ish)800XE – the final machine in the series. Styling the same as 65XE and 130XE. A 130XE with 64 KB RAM. Mainly seen in Eastern Europe.The memory expansion slots on the Atari 800.Prototypes/Vaporware (Never Officially Released) 1400XL – Similar to the 1200XL but with a PBI, FREDDIE chip, built-in modem and speech synthesis chip. Cancelled by Atari.1450XLD – basically a 1400XL with built in 5¼″ disk drive and expansion bay for a second 5¼″ disk drive. Code named Dynasty. Made it to pre-production, but got abandoned by Tramiel.1600XL – codenamed Shakti, this was dual-processor system with 6502 and 80186 processors and two built-in 5¼″ floppy disk drives.900XLF – redesigned 800XLF. Became the 65XE.65XEM – 65XE with AMY sound synthesis chip. Cancelled.65XEP – \"portable\" 65XE with 3.5\" disk drive, 5\" green CRT and battery pack.1090XL expansion system, 5 slots in a large case (never released, small numbers leaked out)1055 3½\" floppy driveXF351 3½\" floppy driveXF354 3½\" floppy driveAtari 8-bit peripherals.There were a huge amount of peripherals released for the 8-bit Atari computers including cassette tape drives, 5.25\" floppy disk drives, printers and even modems. The most common add-on is probably the different cassette tape drives since many games were released on cassette tapes. The peripherals use the SIO port and can be chained together to have more than one peripheral plugged in at once.",

An arcade-based console considerably powerful for a home system at the time, the Neo Geo was notoriously expensive (costing $650 at launch) and aggressively marketed as an Advanced Entertainment System (AES).",

    "description": "Marketing as a \"true-gamer's\" consoleThe Neo Geo AES was born out of SNK's decision to expand its business beyond arcade games and third-party software, and enter the lucrative 16-bit console market. It decided to differentiate the Neo Geo from its competitors by bringing arcade-quality graphics into living rooms. Marketing was heavily geared towards making it a gaming connoisseur's console, and it was even couched as a 24-bit system.The \"24-bit\" marketing label was due to using both the Motorola 68000, a hybrid 16/32-bit CPU, along with the Zilog Z80, an 8-bit CPU. However, Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis console also used the 68000 (at a lower clock speed) and Z80, yet was marketed as a 16-bit console, in comparison.Much of the Neo Geo's advanced graphical capabilities, however, came from the use of custom GPU graphics processors, both within the system as well as additional chips on individual game cartridges, much like an arcade machine. The Neo Geo featured up to seven specialized processors, including the two CPU processors and several graphics chips. And while the RAM was not very large, it could access larger ROM data directly from cartridges at high speeds. These features made the Neo Geo the most powerful home gaming system at the time of its release in 1990, rivalled only by the Sharp X68000 home computer (which also used custom GPU graphics processors). Another new feature of the Neo Geo was the use of removable memory cards to save data; it was the first console to have such a feature.It is the longest supported home platform, having its first game game released in 1990 and the last game, Samurai Shodown V Special, released in 2004.Bare MVS board with typical MVS cartsThe MVS (Multi Video System) was a fantastic innovation for the arcade industry. It allowed arcade operators to save on much-needed space by having a single cabinet have multiple games. The MVS came in two, four, and six slot systems; these would allow gamers to pick which game they wanted at the title screen. The control options were the same as the AES four-button system, the only difference being the controls were mounted to cabinet. A key difference between MVS and AES were the cartridges: a MVS cart will not work in an AES, and vice-versa. The goal behind this incompatibility was to deter arcade operators from buying the cheaper AES cartridges. The MVS carts from did not come with colorful artwork or plastic boxes like their home counterparts; they would often come in plain cardboard boxes with only a marquee slip or flyer.Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcadeCandy Cabs are Japanese sit down cabinets that SNK used for their MVS machines inside Japanese arcades. These machines are typically smaller and lighter than there American counterparts, some weighing as little as 175 lbs (80 kg). This style of cabinet is normally lined in long uniform rows allowing for each person to have their own screen and controls. Vs play is achieved with either vs cabinets in older machines, or newer networking cabinets.Flyer for the MVS Arcade CabinetIn North America Neo Geo games were normally housed in red stand-up cabinets branded with the Neo Geo logo. Becuse by design the MVS had multiple games running on it at one time, the cabinets would rarely have game artwork featured on the side. The North American MVS cabinets supported headphones and a memory card, something that made the MVS unique.North American MVS layoutThe North American Neo Geo cabinets have a 4 button layout labeled with the first four letters of the alphabet. The buttons were always colored the same, A being red, B yellow, C green, and D blue. These were the official colors of the Neo Geo buttons, and would appear this way when presented in game. The control panel itself has a red background with white diagonal stripes coming from both corners, meeting in the middle with a Neo Geo logo. The North American cabinets would normally have HAPP brand buttons, and a bat-top joystick.Typical AES packaging with gamesAES (Advanced Entertainment System) is the term used for describing the home platform of the Neo Geo system, as opposed to the arcade or MVS (Multi Video system) version. The term has since become slang to describe AES cartridges themselves, However the proper name for a AES Neo Geo game is NGH. The way to tell an NGH cartridge from its arcade counterpart is the large colorful artwork featured on the home carts. Arcade cartridges had no branding or consumer packaging because they were hidden inside the machines.Before the AES was made commercially available it was only sold to larger video rental stores who would in turn rent the system out. This was an unusual practice for a video game platform, and was speculated that this was SNK testing the waters for mass consumption.Neo Geo Memory CardThe Neo Geo system was the first platform to use a removable memory card. The Neo Geo memory card was primarily used to continue from where you left off in an arcade game. The Memory card was also cross-compatible with the AES and would allow you to start a game at home and continue in the arcade, or vice versa.Magician Lord, one of the Neo Geo launch titlesOn January 31 1990 in Osaka Japan the Neo Geo AES was made commercially available.The platform launched with nine titles.Cyber-LipMahjong KyoretsudenNAM-1975Joy Joy KidRiding HeroThe Super SpyTop Players GolfMagician LordMinasan no Okagesama DesuThe Neo Geo CD Released In 1994Released in 1994, the Neo Geo CD was an attempt to compete with CD-based hardware. CDs were also much cheaper to produce than the large NGH cartridges, allowing SNK to sell this platform at a cheaper price point. The Neo Geo CD contained mostly the same hardware, but with a CD drive instead of a cartridge slot.The Neo Geo CDZThe Neo Geo CD had a significant downside when compared to the AES: load times. Unlike more popular CD systems at the time thie Neo Geo CD only contained a single speed CD drive, this meant that load times on some games, could be between three to five minutes. While for some systems this would be a burden the fact that the platform was almost exclusively made for fast action arcade experienced this became a much more severe problem for SNK. Fighting games for instance would often load between each round, when compared to it's cartridge counterparts this made the games seemed like lesser products.In 1995 the Neo Geo CD underwent a redesign, and was renamed the Neo Geo CDZ. It had much of the same hardware, but with a dual-speed CD drive and a larger memory cache. This reduced load times for CD-based games. There was only a very limited run of Neo Geo CDZ's in Japan; no North American or European versions where made.The \"24-bit\" marketingThe Neo Geo AES was a notoriously expensive console, costing $650 at launch. There was little effort to emulate or adapt MVS hardware builds for home entertainment use, so cartridges costed as much as existing arcade cabinets ($100-$300). The console failed to gain market share because of these prohibitive costs, although it gained a cult following amongst its targeted demographic of gaming aficionados. The console lost what market share it had earned among enthusiasts by refusing to innovate or improve the system when its competitors did, especially when it did not make the jump to the 32-bit 5th generation of consoles in the late 90s.Efforts to make its games more accessible by porting some of the console's exclusives to specialized arcade cabinets enjoyed limited success, but the console could still not compete with its competitors' price cuts and more extensive game libraries. The increased access to the Neo Geo's library did however cement SNK's reputation as a developer of solid fighting games, fueling its success for the rest of the 90's with hits like the King of Fighters franchise.AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.The console itself ceased manufacture in 1997, but games for the console would continue to be made and released in arcades, mainly in Japan. The last game for the console was made in 2004, giving it the second-longest lifespan for an arcade-to-home console.The Standard Joystick Next to the official Neo Geo CD JoypadThe Neo Geo AES was a unique system because although an officially-endorsed joypad was available, it was not the standard controller. An arcade stick featuring the same layout as the Neo Geo's MVS counterpart was the pack-in controller used for the system. The controllers used 30 mm arcade buttons and a 35mm ball top joystick.The physical base of the the stick was quite large measuring 280mm x 190mm x 95mm (Width Height Depth), nearly the same size as the system. The joystick has a cult following, with the controller having reproductions made for the PS2, PS3 and Wii.A More Extreme Case of Ball Top CrackingAlthough the AES stick has a cult following, it is not without its problems. The buttons on the stick used arcade micro switches but, unlike real arcade buttons, they did not sit inside sleeves. This made it possible for the buttons to rub up against the shell of the stick, this would result in loud squeaking noises or even get stuck underneath the shell. A common aesthetic problem with the AES stick was the joystick ball top getting hairline cracks in the finish, which in extreme cases would cause the ball top to split open. Finally, the button layout on the original Neo Geo was not very ergonomic, a problem which was addressed with the stick's redesignThe Official Neo Geo Mahjong Controller Released in 1990A Mahjong controller was released in 1990 for the Neo Geo AES and is now a rare collectible. It was never released outside of japan because of the lack of interest in Mahjong games outside of the country. It was designed to assist and facilitate the Mahjong games on the AES.Two joysticks where released by Hori, the first in 1991 and the updated version in 1992. These sticks where considered an upgrade to the officially released SNK sticks because they used superior components and an ergonomic layout. The Hori joystick also featured a turbo function.Port of Samurai Shodown for the SNESSNK ported the console's most popular games to other home consoles, and established a joint venture with publisher Takara. The likes of Samurai Shodown, Fatal Fury, and Art of Fighting were made available for the Sharp X68000, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo, Game Boy, Game Gear, 3DO, and Sony Playstation.There is emulation support for the console's games on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, and Neo Geo games are available on Playstation Network for the PS3 and PSP. Game Tap Subscription Service has Neo Geo emulation support.The iconic NEO GEO logoThe Neo Geo AES is a popular collector's item because of the system's quality, rarity, and durability over time. The system's high price point at launch coupled with the fact that games could be hundreds of dollars new meant that most people's libraries of games stayed small. This lead to obscure or popular games becoming more valuable and difficult to track down. For example, the popular AES game Metal Slug regularly sells at auctions for eight hundred to two thousand US dollars. The prices of these games have lead some collectors to modify their AES systems to play significantly cheaper MVS cartridges.SNK went insolvent in 2000, and attributed this to the rampant piracy on the Neo Geo. It was then acquired by the Korean company Playmore, and rebranded as SNK Playmore.Main CPU processor: Toshiba 68HC000 (based on 16/32-bit Motorola 68000) @ 12 MHz Performance: 2.1 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU co-processor: Zilog Z80 (8/16-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Graphics pipeline: PRO chipset (1st gen), LSPC2-A2 & NEO-B1 (2nd gen), NEO-GRZ (last gen)Main GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processors: 1st Generation PRO chipset: PRO-A0PRO-B0 (palette arbiter)PRO-CT0 (graphics serializer, sprite graphics multiplexer)LSPC2-A02nd Generation chipset: LSPC2-A2NEO-B1 (sprite & tiletset multiplexer, line buffer, palette arbiter)Last Generation chipset: NEO-GRZ (all-in-one GPU)Additional GPU processors on board: NEO-G0 (palette data buffer)PRO-C0 (palette arbiter, line buffer)NEO-I0 (graphics memory address latch)NEO-273 / NEO-CMC (graphics memory multiplexer & bankswitching)NEO-ZMC2 (sprite tile serializer)Sony CXA1145 (RGB encoder)Additional GPU processors on cartridges: LSPC2-A2, NEO-B1, PRO-C0, NEO-GRC2-F, NEO-GRZ, NEO-CMCColor palette: 65,536 (16-bit color) Colors on screen: 8,192 (13-bit color) (8 KB on-screen palette RAM)Sprites (tiles) on screen: 381 hardware sprites (without sprite multiplexing) Sprite/Tile sizes: 16x16 to 16x512 pixelsSprites/Tiles per line: 96Texels per line: 1536Display resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsAspect ratio: Standard (4:3)Hardware features: Side-scrolling, vertical scrolling, sprite-scalingLayers/Planes: 1 hardware (non-scrolling)Up to 3 scrolling (requires 128 sprites per plane)Possible A/V outputs: RF, Composite, Component (RGB)Sound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) co-processor is used to control soundMain sound chip: Yamaha YM2610 (15 channel) @ 8 MHz 4 channel FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis, 4 operators per channel3 PSG (Programmable Sound Generator) / SSG (Software Sound Generator) channels7 channel 4-bit ADPCM (Adaptive Differential PCM), six at 18.5 KHz and one up to 55.5 KHz1 programmable noise channel for voices2 interval timersLFO (Low Frequency Oscillator)Sample rate: 24 KHz (FM), 18.5 - 55.5 KHz (PCM)Sound output: StereoDAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) sound chip: Yamaha YM3016RAM (Random-Access Memory)Main RAM (Random Access Memory) Neo Geo: 74 KB (including 64 KB work RAM)Neo Geo CD: 2 MBVideo RAM (VRAM) Neo Geo: 84 KB Main VRAM: 64 KB (including 8 KB on-screen palette RAM)Fast VRAM: 4 KBPalette memory: 16 KBNeo Geo CD: 4.625 MBSound RAM Neo Geo: 2 KB (from Z80)Neo Geo CD: 1088 KB (including 64 KB for Z80)Internal save RAM: 64 KBMemory cards: 2 KB RAM each (official), up to 16 KB each (custom)ROM (Read-Only Memory)ROM (Read-Only Memory) on board: Toshiba (SP-S2 / SP-E) BIOS ROM: 128 KBToshiba LO (Lookup) ROM: 64 KBSound ROM: 128 KBNEC SM1 sound driver ROM: 64 KBNEC SFIX graphics ROM for default fix layer tileset: 128 KBMaximum usable Z80 ROM without bankswitching: 62 KBAdditional ROM on cartridges: Maximum cartridge ROM without bankswitching: 2 MBAdditional sound ROM: 512 KBMaximum 8-bit ADPCM ROM for audio samples: 32 MB16-bit C ROM graphics memory for sprite tiles: VariableMaximum sprite tileset: 128 MBNeoGeo Development Wiki, for more technical details on hardware.",

    "description": "The 3DO started out as an idea by Trip Hawkins, one of the founders of Electronic Arts and was designed by RJ Mical and Dave Needle. It was envisioned as a true multimedia device. Unfortunately, things did not pan out that way.Panasonic 3DO Model FZ-1.The 3DO console was intended to be made by any manufacturer who signed a licensing agreement with the 3DO company. These companies included some of the world’s largest electronics companies at the time: Goldstar, Sanyo, Samsung, AT&T, Creative Labs and even Panasonic, which at the time of the 3DO's release was the largest electronic manufacturer. A second part of 3DO’s business strategy was to be extremely liberal when it came to manufacturing the system; the idea was that there would be no designated system specs. This gave manufacturers the freedom to create anything they wanted for any person or audience. In concept it would give consumers more choices as the 3DO would be extremely upgradeable. The idea was to make the 3DO as simple to manufacture as a CD player, while still functioning as a home entertainment system, a PC, a music player, and, most importantly, a video game system. The 3DO would also allow third party developers to push new technology, like wireless and DVD remote-style controllers, as well as numerous multimedia features.A 3DO of Sanyo manufacturing.Trip Hawkins wanted people to see the 3DO as a multimedia unit; however, with an MSRP of $700, audiences everywhere rejected it as an overpriced piece of tech. Consumers also rejected the 3DO due to its lack of quality launch titles. Some of the manufacturers caught on to how the 3DO was being perceived by audiences and attempted to remedy it by manufacturing cheaper versions of the unit. Their attempts were somewhat limited by the fact that the manufactures of the system got paid for systems sold, but not royalties for the game. Later models were priced downward of $500 but by then the damage had already been done, by this time the Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn were entering the market and could do a lot more for a lot less.The 3DO console debuted in 1993, but with no in-house development and third-party support dwindling, the 3DO was effectively dead by 1997 and in the half-off bins of almost every video game store in America. By the end of the console's life and the bankruptcy of the 3DO company, the console had only sold a measly 2 million units.The 3DO Company did try to follow up the console with a second video game console design dubbed M2, but this console never made it past the initial design and test system phase, effectively cancelling many titles in development for the system, including the prototype for D2. The M2 design was eventually sold off to Panasonic/Matsushita.Despite ultimately being a failure the 3DO featured several notable innovations. While some console manufacturers were still utilizing cartridges, the 3DO embraced the CD format. With special additions, up to 8 players could play cooperatively on a single console. The system also featured an internal memory allowing players to save their game data in the console.Inside a Goldstar 3DO.The console had expansion modules which gave owners the ability to turn their console into a media player. However, expansions that allowed owners to play VHS tapes as well as VCDs were either rare and hard to come by or outrageously expensive. Also, the ability to play VHS tapes was a questionable feature mostly due to VCDs becoming more affordable and visually superior.This again highlights yet another flaw that plagued owners of 3DOs and the console: features that were promised at launch were not a reality. Expansion modules which would have allowed for more RAM or memory never quite came to fruition. In fact, the much requested memory expansion for the unit was only released in Japan and in limited supply in the United States.3DO version of Burning Soldier.Despite being a commercial failure, the 3DO featured an impressive amount of third-party support for its first year. Just like their manufacturing policy, the 3DO Company was extremely liberal when it came to ensuring quality games on their console. A few of the systems highlights include Doom, Samurai Shodown, Lemmings, Need for Speed and Road Rash. On top of that, the 3DO benefited from having ports of arcade games such as the immensely popular Super Street Fighter II Turbo in its catalog. Also, a certain street racing series called Need for Speed got its start on the 3DO. However, quality games for the 3DO came in inconsistent bursts. Also, due to the console's adoption of the CD format, it saw a large number of questionable FMV games that were becoming popular at the time.A lot of the 3DO is highly upgradeable and can differ between manufacturers:32-bit 12.5Mhz RISC CPU (ARM60) made by Advanced RISC Machines (Roughly equivalent to a 25Mhz 68030)Two Accelerated Video Co-Processors with the following features:25Mhz clock rate.Capable of producing 9-16 million REAL pixels per second (36-64 Mpix/secinterpolated), distorted, scaled, rotated and texture mapped.Able to map a rectangular bitmap onto any arbitrary 4-point polygon.Texturemap source bitmaps can be 1,2,4,6,8, or 16 bits per pixel and areRLE compressed for a maximum combination of both high resolution and small storage space.Supports transparency, translucency, and color-shading effects.640x480 pixel resolution at 16.7 million colorsCustom 16-bit Digital Signal Processor (DSP) with the following features: Specifically designed for mixing, manipulating, and synthesizing CD quality sound.Can decompress sound 2:1 or 4:1 on the fly, saving memory and bandwidth.25Mhz clock rate.Pipelined CISC architecture.16-bit register size.17 separate 16-bit DMA channels to and from system memory.On chip instruction SRAM and register memory.20-bit internal processing.Special filtering capable of creating effects such as 3D sound.Separate BUS for video refresh updates (VRAM is dual ported)Super Fast BUS Speed (50 Megabytes per second)Math Co-Processor custom designed by NTG for accelerating fixed-point matrix operations.

This device is probably best remembered for the late-night commercials that ran in the early 1990s showing off its awesome power as a hapless man searched for the \"meaning of life\". The system eventually gives him his answer, after forcing him to play tennis and other video games. The system used compact discs for its software releases, and also featured full motion video content. Philips' attempt to enter the gaming market would be trumped by Sony's PlayStation, which unlike the CD-i, featured 3D-graphics rendering technology and significantly more support from first- and third-party developers.The system also suffered from a bit of an identity crisis. Upon release, Philips did not wish to compete with the likes of Sega and Nintendo in the home console market; instead, Philips positioned the console as a \"multimedia system\" that could play videos, run applications, and could act as an educational tool. This led to a swath of educational game releases, which has never been a bestselling niche in the entertainment software market. Philips tried to position the system as a console that could compete with the likes of the Sega CD and 3DO, but by then most consumers did not view the console as a serious contender to incumbents, not to mention its high starting price and underwhelming library of games.The CD-i also has the notable (and dubious) distinction of being the only non-Nintendo console to have Mario and Zelda titles developed for it, due to a contractual obligation Nintendo had with Philips dating back to the SNES CD project. In total, four such titles existed on the system: Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, Zelda's Adventures and Hotel Mario. A fifth title, Super Mario Wacky Worlds, was planned but never released. None of the titles were developed by Nintendo themselves, but by third parties or by Philips themselves.Phillips sold many varied models on the CD-i system, designed for consumer, professional and development players.The 200 Series models were design of general public consumption and made avail at major home electronics stores worldwide.The 300 Series models were portable versions of the players, designed and marketed for strictly those in the professional fields.The 400 Series models were slimmed-down players that were aimed at educational markets. The 450 model was their budget model - the infrared controller was not standard, but optional - to compete with the other major game consolesThe 600 Series models were designed for professional applications and development.

    "description": "After an absence from the video game console market since the demise of the 7800 system in 1991, Atari made its return with the Jaguar. The system was released in 1993 in San Francisco and in 1994 for the rest of America and Europe. Unfortunately, the Jaguar was a commercial failure that left the company financially crippled. It was the last console Atari produced.In the early 1990s, Atari was negotiating with a British company called Flare Technology, who had designed the unreleased Konix Multisystem console. Atari was impressed by the work Flare had done on the Konix, and provided to the funding to found a new company, Flare 2. Flare 2 started development on two consoles, the 32-bit Panther and the 64-bit Jaguar. Eventually, after seeing the Jaguar's graphical abilities, Atari ceased work on Panther and focused their attention on the more powerful Jaguar. They aimed to surpass the abilities of the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and compete against the new generation of consoles in development by 3DO, Nintendo and Sega, while still remaining cost effective. Despite the Panther's cancellation, some games developed for it saw release. For example, the game Cybermorph that came bundled with the Atari Jaguar was a game designed for Panther.Atari advertised the Jaguar aggressively in the press with its \"Do the Math\" campaign; boasting about its technical superiority over the 16-bit platforms, and claiming to be the first 64-bit home console on the market. While the Jaguar was certainly more powerful than the Super Nintendo and Genesis in most respects, these claims caused some controversy.Many technically knowledgeable industry insiders and gamers claimed that the Jaguar was not a true 64-bit platform, because the Jaguar’s Motorola 68000 CPU chip was only 32-bit, and the primary GPU delivered a 32-bit instruction set. The complaint is similar to the earlier argument that the TurboGrafx-16 was actually an 8-bit system, since it was based around an 8-bit CPU (but with 16-bit video chips), and equally gray.A major contributor to this issue was the industry's desire to use \"bits\" as a concrete measure of subjective \"impressiveness.\" With Sega and Nintendo promoting 16-bit systems as vastly superior to previous 8-bit systems, gamers naturally expected a similar, obvious jump in quality with the Jaguar. In theory, 64-bit games should have been 4x as impressive as 16-bit systems (as frequently cited when the Jaguar is compared to the Nintendo 64). In reality, this is misunderstanding the meaning of \"bits,\" and applying some wishful thinking toward rating a console's performance by a simple number.Ultimately, due to Jaguar's chip set architecture and processing methods, there was just enough to backup Atari’s 64-bit claim. The design, if always followed as intended, would indeed utilise 64-bit graphical processing and buck claims of the Jaguar being simply \"two 32-bit chips glued together.\" Unfortunately, the architecture proved difficult for third-party developers to utilize effectively, and made porting games less profitable - a situation echoed by developers' issues with the Playstation 3. Thus the games most often fell short of the system's theoretical potential.Jaguar programming enthusiasts looking over dumped code from retail titles have suggested many companies treated the Motorola CPU as the main processing unit, instead of as a controller for the 64-bit Tom and Jerry \"workhorse\" chips as Atari intended. This would artificially limit the machine's capabilities, and has been cited as the primary reason for choppy performance in some games (Checkered Flag is a specific example). It is unclear as to how frequently this occurred, and if it was due to poor documentation from Atari, or simply that developers were more familiar with the common 68000 chip.The Jaguar platform did boast some well-received games, including Alien VS Predator, Doom and Tempest 2000, but the graphical leap from 16-bit systems was not extreme, contrary to the expectations Sega had created. Indeed, a large number of Jaguar releases were ports of games released on the Genesis and the Super Nintendo.The Jaguar was a powerful system for its time, with many of the units being sold to the loyal and dedicated Atari fan base that had built up since the early 1980‘s. Many clever and innovative ideas for the system were in the pipeline, most of which never made it past the prototype phase because of poor sales and short life span of the console.The Jaguar’s success was hindered by a number of contributing factors, such as a limited game library, third party software development issues, and fierce competition in the form of Sony’s PlayStation and Sega’s Saturn, which finally finished off the Jaguar by mid-1996.In the late 1990’s Hasbro interactive bought out all Atari properties and declared the Jaguar an open platform for homebrew development. Today the Atari Jaguar has a loyal cult following, who use the console for all sorts of development, including utilizing the COM Lynx and \"CatBox\" device for the networking of up to 32 Jaguar consoles.Graphics processing unit (GPU) – 32-bit RISC architecture, 4 KB internal cache.Object Processor – 64-bit RISC architecture.Blitter – 64-bit RISC architecture; high speed logic operations, z-buffering and Gouraud shading, with 64-bit internal registers.DRAM controller, 32-bit memory management.Digital Signal Processor – 32-bit RISC architecture, 8 KB internal cache. Same RISC core as the GPU, but not limited to graphic production.CD-quality sound (16-bit stereo). Number of sound channels limited by software. 2 DACs (stereo) convert digital data to analog sound signals. Full stereo capabilities.Wavetable synthesis, FM synthesis, FM Sample synthesis, and AM synthesis.A clock control block, incorporating timers, and a UART.Joystick control.Motorola 68000 (used as a manager).General purpose 16/32-bit control processor, (13.295 MHz).2 MB RAM on a 64-bit bus using 4x 16-bit fast page mode DRAMS.Storage - Cartridge – up to 6 MB.Support for COM Lynx I/O.An interesting note is that Jaguar cartridges are generally not region locked, or even linked to PAL or NTSC video rates. While other consoles do this at the software level, Jaguar consoles are PAL or NTSC specific, and the cartridges themselves are commonly agnostic. This is why most Jaguar packaging is in English, French, and German. Production costs were saved by printing one cart type and selling it worldwide.Red Screen of DeathThe Jaguar's cartridge port contains no hinged dust cover or similar protection. The port is simply left exposed on the top of the console. Because of this design flaw, contacts on both the console and the cartridges are extremely sensitive to dust, oil, corrosion, or other elements that prevent a solid contact. Poor contact between the cartridge and the console leads to the common \"Red Screen of Death\" on booting the console. Contrary to popular belief, this does not indicate a hardware failure. In nearly every case, the red screen can be cleared by aggressively cleaning the cartridge with mild solvents (alcohol or peroxide) - just blowing on the cart won't usually do.The following are launch titles for the Jaguar when it was released in November 1993.CybermorphRaidenTrevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy",

    "description": "The Sega CD IIThe Sega CD is the first of two add-on consoles to the Sega Genesis. As its name implies, the system utilized CDs for games instead of cartridges. In addition to game CDs, it was also able to read audio CDs and CD graphics (CD G). In similar fashion to the Sega 32X, the original two Sega CD models (dubbed Sega CD I and II) required a Genesis console to operate. Both models plugged into the bottom of the Genesis, with CD I fitting the older version of the Genesis and the CD II fitting the newer version. The Sega CD I One of the hallmark features of the Sega CD was the inclusion of full motion video (FMV) in games. Though this was revolutionary at the time, the low number of colors (512) the console was able to produce effectively made low quality FMV. This was improved greatly with some Sega CD 32X games, as these were capable of showing 32,768 colors. Between North America, Japan, and Europe approximately 221 Sega CD games were produced (including five Sega CD 32X games). Though a large number of these were original releases, several were simply ports of existing Genesis games with extra content and improved graphics (such as Mortal Kombat and Earthworm Jim). The Sega CDX A portable combo version of the Sega CD/Genesis  was released in 1994, and was similar in appearance and size to portable CD players of that time. Named the Sega CDX, the hybrid console never saw much success in sales, likely due to its high price and the upcoming release of the Sega Saturn.CPU: 12.5 MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processorGraphics: Custom ASIC processor, 64 colors onscreen out of 512, resolution of 320 x 224 or 256 x 224 pixelsRAM: 4 Mbit program RAM, 2Mbit word RAM, 512kbit PCM samples, 128kbit cache, 64kbit backup RAMStorage: 500MB on CD-ROM with a transfer rate of 150 kB/sAudio: Stereo PWM, total 12 MHz clock frequency, 18 total sound channels, max sample rate of 32 kHz, 8 bits of wave data, 16 bit DACDimensions: 301mm x 212.5mm x 112.5mm",

    "description": "The VIC-20Debuting in June 1980 at the Computer Electronics Show, the VIC-20 was Commodore International’s attempt to make a computer which would appeal to more than just computer hobbyists. Commodore wanted to, as their CEO Jack Tramiel put it, \"make a computer for the masses\". The VIC-20 had an unusual beginning as nothing more than a graphics chip. After Commodore could not sell this chip, they decided to construct an entire home computer around it and advertise it as an inexpensive computer that was accessible to every member of the household. The plan worked, and the VIC 20 sold tremendously well when it was first released to the public. It was so successful that the VIC-20 would go down in the history books as the very first computer to have sold more than 1 million units.Commodore PET 4032The VIC was the successor to Commodore's PET line of computers, but Commodore decided to treat the VIC differently as they were going for a completely different audience with this computer. In order to buy a computer from the PET product line, a consumer had to find a licensed seller. As a result, the PET computers were only available at hobby shops or dedicated computer stores. When the VIC arrived Commodore did away with their licensing business model and sold the computer to any store willing to stock them. The computers were appearing everywhere, even auto shops and hardware stores were selling the computers next to their products, and this solidified the VIC as a computer even for people who did not know anything about computers. TV Screen Not IncludedIn April 1980, at a meeting of general managers outside London, Jack Tramiel declared that he wanted a low-cost color computer. When most of the GMs argued against it, he said: \"The Japanese are coming, so we will become the Japanese.\" This was in keeping with Tramiel's philosophy which was to make \"computers for the masses, not the classes\". The concept was championed at the meeting by Michael Tomczyk, newly hired marketing strategist and assistant to the president, Tony Tokai, General Manager of Commodore-Japan, and Kit Spencer, the UK's top marketing executive. Then, the project was given to Commodore Japan; an engineering team led by Yash Terakura created the VIC-1001 for the Japanese market. The VIC-20 first debuted in Japan as VIC-1001 in 1980, before VIC-20 was introduced to the US in 1981.The VIC-20 had a lot of appeal to the mass market due to its simple design and low price, but that started to show some problems of its own. CEO Jack Tramiel, being the frugal and hard liner that he was, told his engineers they could only use 1K chips in the new machine because Commodore had a huge inventory they were unable to use in other products. In the end the VIC had 5.5K of RAM, 2K of which was used by the Basic Operating System. To do any real development in such a small area required a machine language. However, even in the early '80s that simply was not enough RAM for various tasks. This was such an issue that developers of software for the VIC-20 were often forced to write code for the machine by hand. Fortunately, Commodore soon released several ROM expansion packs, similar to what would later be released for the N64. Commodore powered their machine using the 1Mhz, 8 Bit CSG/MOS 6502 CPU. With good (for the time) sound and color graphics, Commodore had produced a technical marvel and the machine became a smash hit. Like the PET, the Commodore VIC-20 was released worldwide relatively quickly after its U.S. and Canadian introduction.The Full PackageLike many of their previous computers the VIC-20 had many innovations that shaped the computer industry greatly. The Commodore VIC-20 was the first color computer that retailed as a \"computer for the masses\" at less than US$300.But a low selling price wasn't the only thing that Commodore used to entice non computer hobbyists to buy their computer. The VIC-20 utilised a user-friendly version of BASIC 2.0 allowing for easy programming. The VIC-20 could be attached to any mainstream television to allow for visuals, so it did not require a dedicated monitor. As such, the VIC-20 was an important breakthrough for computers overall as the VIC-20 provided many consumers with their first experience with basic programming. The VIC-20 also had a floppy disk expansion and could be connected to a printer like all computers at the time.Some critics said the machine was seriously underpowered, and for the most part they were correct. Despite this lack of power the computer sold extremely well, helped in part by advertising campaigns featuring William Shatner.Other than the extremely affordable price, consumers were attracted to the VIC because of its user-friendly deisgn that didn't require unnecessary input to use. For its ease of use and affordable price the VIC-20 sold over 2.5 million units worldwide.The End of an EraThe VIC-20's lifespan was cut short by the early 1980s. Late 1982 saw the beginning of the end with the announcement of the Commodore 64. At first the idea of a new Commodre computer went largely ignored, and it was believed that if the rumors were true it was merely a new version of the VIC. In fact at one point people thought the C64 was actually a codename for a VIC-64.When the rumors were finally confirmed, VIC 20 users and sellers panicked. For the average computer hobbyist hardware upgrading was already a common concept. For the mass market however, the idea that they would have to buy a new computer to replace a recently purchased piece of technology was new and unusual. This panic led many VIC-20 retailers to dramatically drop the price of the computer, which in turn devalued the computer and affirmed Commodore's belief that it was time to drop support for the computer. By 1984 it was obvious that there would not be a place in the Commodore lineup for the venerable VIC-20 and all production for the computer ceased in favor of the C64.

The VolksComputer was a big hit in Europe. The impetus for changing the name was likely that \"VIC\" spoken the German way is very close to fuck.The Commodore Executive responsible for the VIC's development, Michael Tomczyk, has stated repeatedly that he choose the name simply because he thought it \"sounded good\".

It was the first home console on the market to include an internal hard drive by default. This was a breakthrough at the time as it made games run faster that used the HDD and also allowed players to save their progress without the use of a Memory Card. The Xbox shipped with a custom made Intel processor based on the Intel III architecture. This processor allowed faster calculations resulting in a much more realistic gaming experience at the time. nVidia produced the Xbox’s GPU which allowed better graphics than other consoles at the time.The Duke.When first released, the controller (with the exception of the controller found in Japan) was criticized for being abnormally large compared to its competitors.

The Xbox was the first console to charge an annual fee to play online and introduced fully integrated online gaming on home consoles with the introduction of Xbox Live.When the Xbox launched on November 21, 2001, the console quickly sold out in North America. In Japan, however, the console sold only 250,000 units. After its release in November 2004 Halo 2 became the best selling Xbox title worldwide, selling over 8 million copies, thanks in large part to the quality of its online multiplayer through Xbox Live. It was arguably the most popular online mutliplayer shooter on home consoles during the sixth-generation of consoles.According to Microsoft the Xbox has sold over 24 million worldwide as of 2006.Microsoft officially no longer offers console repairs on the Xbox after March 2, 2009.

QD stands for \"Quaque Die\", which is Latin for \"Every Day\"N-Gage QDNew revamped look.Games could be switched without removing the battery.The earpiece was moved to the front of the device.No support for MP3 playback.The N gage QD also had a memory problem known as the white screen of death, the white screen of death became a serious problem with many users as it was easy to get the problem. The problem was that if the internal memory on the phone (3 MB) had been fully used up, then the phone would start using memory from the phones Ram. This meant that the phone would no longer have enough memory to start up the phone or even open the main menu to delete the files taking up the memory. Once this problem occurs if you turn off the N gage then it will no longer work, when turned back on the N gage would show a white screen and stay that way until the phone was switched off, now known as the white screen of death. Another problem with this was that there was and still isn't anyway to fix the N gage after getting the white screen of death, the only known way of fixing is for it to be sent to an official Nokia store.Tiger Woods fully supported onlineThe N-Gage also fully supported online play with some games, N-Gage arena allowed players to play against other people wherever they were, even with no wi-fi connectivity at all. However N-Gage Arena had problems, such as having to register with your network provider, which was a problem as some networks did not allow N gage Arena despite working on the N-Gage console. Arena also suffered from lag problems and slow down and was sadly never used by many players, meaning that the people who did play on N-Gage Arena could rarely find another player to play with, however Nokia still even today supports N-Gage Arena in some countries (such as UK) and still works just as well as it originally did.N-Gage Arena was also used in some games as a global high score service. Some games, such as Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1 used this service so players could compare their scores with people from all over the world.The New N-Gage serviceIn 2008 Nokia released a mobile gaming service, under the N-Gage brand. The company dropped the idea of combining cellphones with handheld gaming devices, and chose to make N-gage a part of their Ovi internet services instead. This service is only available on certain Nokia smartphones running the company's S60 software platform, including several Nseries, Eseries and XpressMusic phones. The revamped N-gage service resembles Microsoft's Xbox Live, with additions like N-Gage points, and gamer profiles.With the N-Gage platform games are downloaded to the phone, and doesn't support the game cartridges the old N-gage system used. That means there is no backwards compatibility whatsoever. Several first generation N-gage games were ported over to the new platform. It was announced in October 2009 that the service would be shut down by the end of 2010.Nokia's most recent phone with a capacity comparing to the Android.n85 Specs:DimensionsForm: Two-way sliderVolume: 76 ccWeight: 128 gDimensions: 103 × 50 × 16.0 mmTwo-way slider with spring assistance mechanismmicroSD memory card slot, hot swappable, max. 32 GB (After firmware update)128 MB internal dynamic memory78 MB internal NAND flash memoryHSDPA, maximum speed 3.6 Mbps (DL)WCDMA 900/1900/2100, maximum speed PS 384/384 kbps (UL/DL)EDGE class B, multislot class 32, maximum speed 296/177.6 kbps (DL/UL)GPRS class A, multislot class 32, maximum speed 107/64.2 kbps (DL/UL)HSCSD, maximum speed 43.2 kbit/sCSDWLAN 802.11b, 802.11gWLAN Security: WPA2-Enterprise, WPA2-Personal, WPA-Enterprise, WPA-Personal, WEPWLAN Quality of Service: WMM, U-APSDWLAN wizardTCP/IP supportCapability to serve as data modemSize: 2.6\"Resolution: 320 × 240 pixels (QVGA)Up to 16.7 million coloursActive Matrix OLED technologyBL-5K 1200 mAh Li-Ion batteryTalk time (maximum):GSM 6.9 hWCDMA 4.5 hVoIP 6 hStandby time (maximum):GSM 363 hWCDMA 363 hWLAN 172 hBrowsing time with packet data (maximum): 5 h 42 minVideo playback time (maximum): 7 hVideo recording time (maximum): 2 h 54 minVideo call time (maximum): 2 h 42 minGaming time (maximum): 7 hQuad-band EGSM 850/900/1800/1900WCDMA 2100/1900/850 (in the Americas) and 2100/1900/900 (everywhere else)Automatic switching between WCDMA/GSM bandsFlight modeBluetooth version 2.0 with Enhanced Data Rate.Bluetooth profiles:Dial Up Networking Profile (Gateway)Object Push Profile (Server and Client)File Transfer Profile (Server)Hands Free Profile (Audio Gateway)Headset Profile (Audio Gateway)Basic Imaging Profile (Image Push Responder and Initiator)Remote SIM Access Profile (Server)Device Identification ProfilePhone Book Access Profile (Server)Stereo Audio Streaming:Generic Audio/Video Distribution ProfileAudio/Video Remote Control Profile (A/V Remote Control Target)Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (Audio Source)Add-on solutions enable integration into enterprise private branch exchange (PBX) infrastructureDLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) certificationUPnP supportMTP (Mobile Transfer Protocol) supportTV out (PAL) with Nokia Video Connectivity Cable (CA-75U, in box inclusion may vary based on sales package configuration)Nokia XpressPrintSupport for local and remote SyncML synchronization",

    "description": "The PlayStation 3 (PS3) was officially unveiled at Sony Computer Entertainment America's Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference on May 16, 2005. When it was initially announced, Sony stated that it would be part of a longer cycle for consoles, stating that it would be part of a ten year cycle.Sony initially announced two hardware configurations for the PlayStation 3: The 60GB and the 20GB, though the 40GB, 80GB, 120GB, 160GB, 250GB and 320GB configurations have been released since then. The PS3 was announced for a simultaneous worldwide release with a launch date of November 11, 2006 for Japan and November 17, 2006 for the United States and Europe. But due to a shortage of the blue laser diodes used for the Blu-ray Disc drive, the European launch was subsequently delayed to March 23, 2007.The PS3 uses the Cell Broadband Engine co-developed by Sony, IBM, and Toshiba. Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX 'Reality Synthesizer', which can output resolutions up to 1080p HD. The PS3 has 256 MB of XDR main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX, for a total of 512 MB system memory.Since its launch, the PS3 has a worldwide install base of over 80 million units.The system was released in North America on November 17th, 2006 (November 11th in Japan, March 23rd in Europe). The launch of the PlayStation 3 proved to be a rather difficult one for many reasons. One was the high price point for the console; $599 for the 60GB model in the US. Another was the launch line-up and the infamous E3 2006 press conference which failed to impress gamers, and instead started many internet memes, like Giant enemy crab and Massive damage. Finally, the marketing campaign \"Play B3yond\" was negatively received for its approach and weirdness, mostly concerning a TV spot featuring a plastic baby, laughing and finally crying watching a PS3. The North American launch line-up was the following:Call of Duty 3Genji: Days of the BladeMadden NFL 07Marvel: Ultimate AllianceMobile Suit Gundam: CrossfireNBA 2K7NBA 07Need for Speed: CarbonNHL 2K7Resistance: Fall of ManRidge Racer 7Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07Tony Hawk's Project 8Untold Legends: Dark KingdomThe Original PlayStation 3 ( non 20gb model)The 20 GB was available at launch in Japan on November 11th 2006, in North America on November 17th 2006.The 20 GB PS3 has a slot loading 2x speed Blu-ray Disc drive that plays Blu-ray movies, DVDs, CDs, and SACDs. It has built-in Bluetooth 2.0, a Gigabit Ethernet port, 4 USB 2.0 ports, and HDMI 1.3a. The 20GB PS3 also has backwards compatibility with PlayStation 1 & 2 titles through hardware emulation. The 20GB PS3 had an MSRP of $499.99 USD. It was discontinued on April 11th, 2007 due to poor sales compared to the 60 GB.The 60GB PS3 was launched in Japan on November 11th 2006, then in North America on November 17th 2006. It has all of the features of the 20GB model plus 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, a multiple flash card reader, and a chrome finish. The original MSRP was $599.99. It was discontinued on July 13th, 2007.The PS3 launched with a 60 GB model in Europe on March 23rd 2007. An important difference between the European and American 60 GB model was the backwards compatibility. Unlike the American version, PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility was carried out via hardware and software emulation, foreshadowing the eventual 80GB model. The RRP of this model was €599.In August 2007, Sony released an 80 GB model of the PS3 in the US, which included backwards compatibility. This was enabled by using software emulation to emulate PS2 games. Because, it was software based, it only allowed for ~60% of PS2 titles to be played with no issues.The 40 GB PS3 was launched in Europe/Australia in October 2007 and North America/Japan in November 2007. The 40 GB model had the multiple flash card reader and SACD supported removed, and is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles but is still compatible with original PlayStation titles. The 40 GB PS3 had a MSRP of $399.99. For a limited time only, Spider-Man 3 was packaged along with the 40 GB model.Another 80 GB PS3 was launched in August 2008 in North American and Japan in October 2008. It sports all of the features of the 40 GB model and has an MSRP of $399.99 . At Sony's Gamescom 2009 keynote, Kaz Harai announced that the standard PS3 pricepoint is to be reduced by $100 to $299.99 as of August 19, which at the time applied to both this and the 160 GB model.The 160 GB PS3 was announced at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2008. The model will be coming to North America in November as part of a bundle which includes Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, a voucher for a free download of PAIN and a DualShock 3 for $499.99. This model will be released in Europe on October 31 for the cost of €499 RRP ($628) but will be packed with €70 ($88) worth of additional DLC.Interestingly enough, the original model shown off at the Electronic Expo in 2005 boasted a couple of different features. The original planned configuration was to have at least 2 HDMI ports and up to 6 USB ports (2 ports on the back). This was later cut down to four for the launch and the HDMI ports cut down to one, with the reasoning being that there was actually no need for so many ports. It was shown in three different colors; white, silver, and piano black, but only black was available for launch. It was also sporting the now infamous boomerang controller, but that design was scrapped in favor of the more traditional DualShock design.The PlayStation 3 SlimThe Slim 120 GB model of the PS3 was announced at Gamescom 2009 by Kaz Harai at Sony's keynote on August 18. The new model is 33% smaller and 36% lighter, and consumes 34% less power. The Slim shares mostly the same features as the most recent SKU's. The one notable exception, however, is that the ability to install a second operating system was removed. Also, there was a stand introduced to support it when vertically oriented, similar to the PS2 Slim, though it has been shown to be unnecessary. This model was released on September 1, 2009 at an MSRP of $299.99 in the U.S., £249.99 in the U.K. and €299.99 in the rest of Europe.This is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $349.99 when released on November 3, 2009 in the U.S. There was also a white Final Fantasy XIII bundle in Japan released on December 17.This is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $299.99 when released in August 2010 in the U.S.This is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $349.99 when released on September 19, 2010 in the U.S. This system also comes as a PlayStation Move bundle, including the game Sports Champions.PS3 \"Super Slim\"Announced at TGS 2012 and released on September 25 in North America, the PS3 \"Super Slim\" is the 3rd and most likely final version of the PS3. it's less than half the size and weight of the original PS3 and 20 percent less volume and 25 percent less weight of the Slim PS3. It includes a 250GB hard drive and retails for $269 USD. For a limited time, Uncharted 3 game of the year edition and a $30 voucher Dust 514 will be included in the package.The \"Super Slim\" 500GB model is exactly the same as the 250GB model, except it has double the hard drive space. It retails for $299 USD and was released in October in North America. For a limited time, Assassins Creed III will be included in the package.The developer kits originally cost $20,000 each, and they were cut down to $10,000 sometime in 2008. Now the PS3 developer kit has been price cut again to $2,000, a drop of 80%.At GDC '09, Sony announced a new initiative for PlayStation Network titles allowing developers to self-publish games on the platform. If you make a downloadable game exclusively for PSN, Sony will guarantee royalties by reimbursing development costs as well as supplying support for game design and marketing. They also insist that the developer will still retain control of the intellectual property and set pricing. Burn Zombie, Burn, was the first title released on PSN under this initiative.What could have beenThe PlayStation 3 currently has many different first and third party accessories.Sony first launched the PS3 with the Sixaxis. It charges its built-in lithium ion battery via USB cable and has a battery life of roughly thirty hours fully charged. It connects to the system via Bluetooth and lacks any sort of rumble function. Originally, Sony's reason for this was that they found the motion control functions of the controller to be more immersive than the rumble function and they were technically unable to combine them at the time. Although it is more likely due to the lawsuit from Immersion. The two games that were used to demonstrate the motion capabilities of the system were Lair and Warhawk.DualShock 3At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced the DualShock 3 because despite Sony's original belief that the controller didn't need rumble, the fans asked. This was a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with the vibration capability included. It has a lithium ion battery as well with a battery life of roughly 25 hours, and it charges via USB. Similarly to the Sixaxis, this controller connects to the PlayStation system via Bluetooth. Because of the added functionality of the rumble, the controller weighs more then it's older brother.This headset is compatible with cellphones and the PS3. After firmware update 2.50, it supports a visual volume level cue, along with the current battery charge. It comes with a USB docking station used for charging the headset. It can be paired via Bluetooth or USB cable. The headset launched bundled with SOCOM: Confrontation. However, it can also be purchased separately for an MSRP $49.99.A new version of the headset was released in November 2010. The new features include a smaller and lighter package, noise cancellation, better device compatibility and better transmit and receive sound.For those who do not like using the Sixaxis or DualShock controllers while watching their movies can use the standalone Bluetooth remote released by Sony. It has all the functionality of the regular controllers minus the ability to use it while playing a game, and is in a regular controller form.The PlayStation Eye is the successor to the EyeToy, and is a camera with a built-in microphone array. This accessory was originally packaged with the game The Eye of Judgement. In addition to simply capturing video and audio, it can also be used for motion control.Keypad attached to the controllerA wireless keypad was added as an accessory in December 2008. It is designed for faster text messaging and PS3 compatibility. It is a separate Bluetooth device, with its own battery and it connects to the and sticks over the top side of the DualShock 3 controller. It comes with certain preset buttons for friends list and with a touchpad for \"quicker and better\" internet browsing. Response to the keypad has been mixed, with some complaints due to its small buttons with no back light and dodgy touchpad.Sony PlayStation AC AdapterThe PlayStation AC Adapter is a USB based charger that plugs into an ordinary wall outlet. It's designed to charge the Sixaxis controller, the DualShock 3 controller, the Bluetooth headset and the wireless keypad, all without the need to turn on your PlayStation. You can also charge your controller while playing your PlayStation, something you can't do with some other aftermarket controller charging docks. It will also charge the PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. The AC adapter retails in the United States for $24.99 and the United Kingdom for £19.99.Released in October, 2010, with a MSRP of $179.99, the official PS3 sound bar is a 2.1 channel audio device that mimics surround sound systems. The system has 2 sound settings \"Dynamic\" and \"Night\". The night setting attempts to enhance key sounds when the volume is low.A TV tuner accessory which connects to the PlayStation 3 and allows the system to be used like a DVR, and record your favorite TV shows directly onto the PlayStation hard drive. This accessory is currently only available in Europe.PlayStation MoveAt E3 2009, Sony introduced the unnamed motion controller to the mass market via a few impressive tech demos. The wand has a colored orb on top that is tracked by the PlayStation Eye and sensors within, which combine to allow true one-to-one tracking. At Sony's 2010 GDC keynote, it was announced that the official name would be the PlayStation Move. A sub-controller was also revealed, dubbed the \"Navigation Controller.\" The navigation controller has no sensors, so a DualShock controller can be used as a substitute for the navigation controller if the user is prepared to deal with the slightly uncomfortable grip one must use to operate the DualShock in conjunction with the wand controller.Planned for release in September 2011, with a MSRP of $99.99. It's an alternative option to the PS3 sound bar above. It's a 2 channel system, but simulates 7.1 channel audio. It also has a built in mic for online chat.The PlayStation Network, or PSN, is Sony's free online service which allows PS3 and PSP owners to communicate with each other, play games, compare trophies, and download content from the PlayStation Store. As well as giving access to the interactive lobby and game launching system, PlayStation Home. Recently, the ability to display your Trophy collections on internet forums was added through the official PlayStation web site. To get this new feature, you sign in with your PSN ID, under the network tab and then it syncs to you PS3 and downloads all the information. From there, you choose your favorite game, your mood, as well as leave a little comment, and then you can post it on any forum as a signature.The PlayStation 3 XMBFirmware 1.60, released in May 22, 2007, added the Folding@Home client.

Another significant feature added with this update was PlayStation Trophies, which were a greatly requested feature. There was some buzz about this firmware causing problems for certain console owners, so it was taken down, and only a short while later, a revised version, Firmware 2.41, was released on July 8th 2008.Firmware 2.50, released October 15, 2008, added automatic shut down for the PS3 system and the controllers.

    "description": "The Nintendo Revolution, a prototype to the WiiThe successor to the Nintendo GameCube, the Nintendo Wii was officially unveiled at Nintendo's Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference in 2005.Development for the Wii began in 2001 shortly before the launch of the Nintendo GameCube as Shigeru Miyamoto, came up with a concept focusing primarily on a new form of player interaction. Branching off from the traditional game pad controller from Nintendo's previous consoles, the Wii features a wireless controller, referred to as the Wii Remote, which is used as a handheld pointing device and detects movement in three dimensions. Although the console was unveiled earlier in the year at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the Wii Remote was not shown until the Tokyo Game Show in September of that year.The Wii launched in North America on November 19, 2006, December 2, 2006 in Japan and on December 8, 2006 in Europe. Since its launch, the console has sold over 50 million consoles as of March 2009. The Wii has been infamous for its limited availability, and people have complained about how few consoles can be found in stores. According to Nintendo, they are making nearly one million Wii consoles per month, however. The Wii continues Nintendo's tradition of choosing lower specifications of hardware components to be able to gain a profit off the hardware alone. Where their competitors are willing to lose money upfront off the hardware sales and make up for the loss with software and subscription based revenues.Originally, the console was known as the 'Nintendo Revolution', a code name to explain Nintendo's plans with the console. When it was unveiled, it was dark black, but upon its release it had changed to a white and blue color scheme. The name Wii has had many official explanations.Nintendo stated that the plural form of Wii is, contrary to popular belief, not \"Wiis.\" Instead, it is \"Wii consoles\" or \"Wii systems.\" The two i's in Wii are meant to represent two players standing next to each other, or the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. One explanation for the name is as follows:\"Wii sounds like 'we,' which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion. No need to abbreviate. Just Wii.\"The Wii has been criticized for disrupting the way game publishers have been doing business for years. The ease for game publishers to release games on the platform caused a lot of competition in the Wii market, where normally very popular types of games in other systems would fail to become popular on the Wii. However, the Wii became one of the best selling video game systems ever made, breaking records worldwide, including the best selling video game system in Europe, as well as many of it's games going on to become the best selling videogames of all time.The \"Family Edition\" Wii ModelIn December 2011 Nintendo discontinued the launch model of the Wii and released a \"Slim\" version of the Wii in Europe. No specific reason is given by Nintendo for this re-release. The \"Slim\" Wii has the same specifications as the launch model with the exception for GameCube support, resulting in no support for GameCube games and the lack of GameCube controller ports and GameCube memory card slots. The console launched in the colors black and white and is bundled with a Wii MotionPlus, Wii Sports and Wii Party. Because of its horizontal orientation and smaller form factor, it is said to fit under TV sets more easily.Avatar: The Last AirbenderCall of Duty 3CarsDragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2Excite TruckThe Grim Adventures of Billy & MandyGT Pro SeriesHappy FeetThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight PrincessMadden NFL 07Marvel: Ultimate AllianceMonster 4x4 World CircuitNeed for Speed: CarbonRampage: Total DestructionRayman Raving RabbidsRed SteelSpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty KrabSuper Monkey Ball: Banana BlitzTony Hawk's Downhill JamTrauma Center: Second OpinionWii Sports (bundled with the Wii console)Crayon Shin-chan: Saikyou Kazoku Kasukabe King WiiElebitsEnnichi no TatsujinKororinpaThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight PrincessMachi-Kuru DominoNecro-Nesia (Escape from Bug Island)Rayman Raving RabbidsRed SteelSD Gundam G BreakerSuper Monkey Ball: Banana BlitzSuper Swing GolfTamagotchi: Party On!Trauma Center: Second OpinionWarioWare: Smooth MovesWii PlayWii SportsWing IslandBarnyardCall of Duty 3CarsFar Cry: VengeanceGottlieb Pinball ClassicsGT Pro SeriesHappy FeetThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight PrincessMadden NFL 07Marvel: Ultimate AllianceMonster 4x4 World CircuitNeed for Speed: CarbonOpen SeasonRampage: Total DestructionRayman Raving RabbidsRed SteelSpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty KrabSuper Fruit FallSuper Monkey Ball: Banana BlitzTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double AgentTony Hawk's Downhill JamWii PlayWii Sports (Bundled with the Wii console)Donkey KongMario Bros.PinballSoccerSolomon's KeyWario's WoodsThe Legend of ZeldaF-ZeroSimCitySuper Mario 64Altered BeastSonic The HedgehogBonk's AdventureBomberman '93Super Star SoldierDungeon ExplorerVictory RunDonkey KongSuper Mario Bros.The Legend of ZeldaWario's WoodsDonkey Kong CountryF-ZeroSuper Mario 64Altered BeastEcco the DolphinGolden AxeSonic The HedgehogThe Nintendo WiiThe Wii is the smallest of the seventh generation consoles measuring 44 mm (1.73 in) wide, 157 mm (6.18 in) tall, 215.4 mm (8.48 in) deep, approximately the size of three standard DVD cases stacked together, and weighs in at 2 kg (2.7 lb).The Wii launch retail package comes at an MSRP of $249.99 USD, and $279.99 CAD which includes the Wii console, one Wii Remote, one Nunchuk attachment, one Sensor Bar, a removable stand for the bar, one external main power adapter, two AA batteries, one composite AV cable with RCA connectors, a SCART adapter in European countries (component video and other types of cables are available separately), operation documentation, a stand to allow the console to be placed vertically, a circular clear stabilizer for the main stand, and, in all regions except Japan and South Korea, a copy of the game Wii Sports.The Wii is powered by the PowerPC based \"Broadway\" processor and its graphics processing is powered by the ATI \"Hollywood\" GPU, 88MB of main memory, a slot-loading disc drive compatible with 8 cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs and 12 cm Wii Optical Discs, 512 MB built-in NAND flash memory, and an SD Card memory slot.On May 9th, 2010, a Black version of the Wii will be released for sale in America.Wii RemoteUsing a combination of accelerometers and infrared detection built in to sense its position in a 3 dimensional space when pointed at the Wii's sensor bar, Wii Remote is the primary controller for the console. The controller communicates with the console using Bluetooth technology and features rumble vibration and an internal speaker. The Wii Nunchuck unit also features an accelerometer with an added traditional analog stick with two trigger buttons. By using the Wii Remote, users can control the game using physical movements as well as traditional button pressesThe body of the Wii Remote measures 148 mm long, 36.2 mm wide, and 30.8 mm thick (5.83 in x 1.43 in x 1.21 in). It interacts wirelessly with the Wii console through a short-range bluetooth radio.The Wii Remote has a total of 11 input buttons, counting each direction of the directional pad as one input.The \"A\" button is located on top of the controller, and is a transparent plastic button. It is generally used for selecting things on menus.The directional pad is Game Boy style and cross-shaped, with four gray lines on top of the pad going out in each directionThe 1 and 2 buttons are placed vertically near the bottom of the remote, and are used as a pause button in some games. In games where you use the remote horizontally, they are often used as \"A and B\" buttons.The plus and minus buttons, located in the middle of the remote, are usually used to bring up menus.The home button is located in between the plus and minus buttons, and brings up a menu that allows you to go to the Wii Menu, reset your console, or edit Wii Remote menus.A power button is located in the top left corner of the remote.The \"B\" trigger is located on the back of the Wii Remote, and is generally used to return to previous menus, or to fire weapons in shooters.(None of the clock frequencies have been officially confirmed by either Nintendo, IBM or ATI.)Broadway CPUCPU: IBM PowerPC-based \"Broadway\" processor, made with a 90 nm SOI CMOS process, clocked at 729 MHzGPU: ATI \"Hollywood\" GPU, made with a 90 nm CMOS process, clocked at 243 MHz88 MB main memory (24 MB internal 1T-SRAM integrated into graphics package, 64 MB external GDDR3 SDRAM)3 MB embedded GPU texture memory and framebufferHollywood GPUFour possible Wii Remote controllers, connected via BluetoothFour Nintendo GameCube controller ports (Not on the \"Slim\" model)Two Nintendo GameCube Memory Card slots (Not on the \"Slim\" model)SD memory card slotTwo USB 2.0 slotsSensor Bar portAccessory port on Wii Remote (used to connect Nunchuk and other peripherals)USB keyboard input, compatible with Wii Shop Channel and Internet Channel (versions 3.0 and 3.1)Mitsumi DWM-W004 WiFi 802.11b/g wireless moduleCompatible with USB 2.0 to Ethernet LAN adaptorMultiAV output for component, composite, and S-VideoA SanDisk 2 GB SD Card made specifically for Wii512 MB built-in NAND flash memorySD card memory (supports SDHC as of System Menu 4.0, up to 32 GB)Two Nintendo GameCube Memory Card Slots (for GameCube save states, Not on the \"Slim\" model)Slot-loading disc drive compatible with 8 cm Nintendo GameCube game discs and 12 cm Wii optical discsMask ROM by MacronixA comparison of an in-game aspect ratio of the wii console.

It is designed to operate with \"channels\" on a television. Each square is a \"channel\" that has a different function. Channels have been added since the six available at launch, and periodical updates are available for the Wii Menu. The Wii Menu is navigated via the Wii Remote, and channels can be moved (with the exception of the Disc Channel) by holding down the A and B buttons and then dragging the channel.Wii Menu 4.0GDC 2009 Nintendo revealed the \"complete storage solution for the Wii.\" This storage solution is included in the new Wii Menu 4.0, which features an SD card icon in the bottom left, next to the Wii circle. Clicking on the icon brings you to the SD card menu, where up to 20 screens are fillable. Games can be downloaded to and launched directly from an SD or SDHC card without going through the Wii System Memory menus. The 4.0 update also enabled SD cards above the 2 GB capacity.Wii MenuDisc Channel - The default channel that is used to play games. When a disc is loaded in (either Wii or GameCube), the two discs spin around, eventually stop, and then one falls down as if it is being loaded in a slot. Then, the game's splash screen appears, and the player has the option to either play the game or return to the Wii Menu screen.Mii Channel - Another default channel, the Mii Channel is used to design custom avatars known as Miis. Players can customize many aspects of their virtual avatar. The Mii interactivity is one of the frequently advertised parts of the Wii.Photo Channel - Players can upload pictures and videos through use of an SD card or from received messages on the Wii message board, and then use various effects to alter the image. Sound files .MP3, .AAC, and .M4A are also compatible with the channel, so the user can play a slideshow accompanied by music. The Photo Channel's icon in the Wii Menu can be customized with a picture.Wii Shop Channel - The Wii Shop Channel is a channel that allows users to purchase games. It is divided into three categories: Virtual Console, WiiWare, and Wii Channels. Games can be purchased on the Virtual Console that have been released in previous generations, from a variety of consoles. WiiWare consists of small-budget games that have been released by amateur developers wanting to get a name, or sometimes larger companies releasing games not big enough for a retail release. Wii Points must be purchased to buy any games on this channel, which can be bought in increments of 1000 ($10.00 USD) on the channel itself, or in various retail stores (Nintendo Points).Forecast Channel - Users navigate a large 3D world to find weather forecasts for their area. By merely clicking on the channel, however, users can see a quick forecast if WiiConnect24 is on. Some games use the information from the Forecast Channel to change the in-game weather (such as Madden NFL 07 and NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams).News Channel - The News Channel allows users to view headlines from various current events. The news articles are from the Associated Press, and are available in a variety of languages. The news headlines are available in many different categories, and they are automatically updated as news comes in.Internet Channel - The Internet Channel is a browser for the Wii based on the Opera browser. Originally, it was free, but it is now available for a one time payment of 500 Wii Points ($5.00 USD), although users who downloaded it for free do not have to pay. The browser has USB keyboard compatibility and supports many of the same standards as the Opera browser available for computers.Everybody Votes Channel - The Everybody Votes Channel is a channel where users vote in a variety of opinion polls. All questions are created by Nintendo, based off of submitted user questions. You can track your stats, such as your \"distance from popular opinion\", and good you are at predicting the popular answer. A map showing how ones specific country votes is also available to users.Check Mii Out Channel - The Check Mii Out Channel allows users to upload and download others' Miis and share them to users around the world. There are also themed contests designed by Nintendo, where each user can submit a Mii and vote on their favorites from all the entries.Nintendo Channel - The Nintendo Channel is essentially a preview of upcoming and recently released Wii and Nintendo DS games. There are a variety of trailers to watch and browse, including videos of core gameplay and promotional videos. Nintendo DS game demos can be downloaded via this channel as well, turning your Wii into something similar to a DS-download station.Original WiiWare Channel ImageThere also have been a few channels made available only in Japan: Television Friend Channel (Terebi no Tomo Channel), Digicam Print Channel, Fortune Telling Channel (Kyou to Ashita no Uranai Lucky Channel), and Wii no Ma (see below). Some games add a channel when the game is booted up for the first time, and a few channels are made available by using the DS connectivity feature. One retired channel, the Metroid Prime 3 Preview Channel, was made available temporarily, but now previews are distributed through the Nintendo Channel.Horoscope Wii ChannelA channel that gives horoscopes.TV Guide ChannelThere is also a TV Guide Channel released in Japan where it very intuitively shows the different times for TV programming by using well organized charts. It even allows you to actually use the Wii remote as a TV remote, changing channels and increasing volume.First image of Wii no Ma ChannelWii no Ma Channel (video download service)Nintendo has given an official notice about its upcoming video download service. The new Video service will be called Wii no Ma Channel. This channel will be free in spring but only for Japan. This channel is a joint project between Nintendo and Dentsu. This channel does not have a certain group or genre it is trying to provide. This channel will offer paid and free video content. The free content will be paid by advertisers. Nintendo is also thought of sending this channel overseas but have said the timing is not right.Food Delivery ChannelFood Delivery ChannelSpring 2009 Nintendo will introduce a new Wii channel called \"Food Delivery Channel\" only for Japan. It allows you to order food using the Demae-can.com online food ordering service. The food that can be ordered are pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Japanese food, Western food, curry, etc. When you select a food a song that matches the food's mood will play on the Channel. If you can decide what to eat there is a roulette mode that picks your meal at random. The quickest delivery order will arrive is 30 minutes.Wii Fit ChannelWii Fit allows the Wii Fit Channel to be installed. This channel lets users view and compare their results, as well as their progress in the game, without requiring the game disc.Mario Kart ChannelMario Kart Wii allows the Mario Kart Channel to be installed. This channel allows players to see their best Time Trial scores for each track and compare with other players' results. Players can also manage their friends list and see if any of them are online. Players can also check their tournament standings. All without requiring the game disc.Wii Speak ChannelUsers that have bought the Wii Speak peripheral will be able to download the Wii Speak Channel through the Wii Shop Channel via a download-ticket that comes with the microphone. In the Wii Speak Channel, users can join one of four rooms (no limit to how many people in each room) to chat with others online, with each person represented by their Mii, which lip-syncs to their words. Also, users can send audio message to others via the Wii Message Board. Photo sharing is also available in each room.Before the Wii was announced, a fan created a fake trailer showcasing the \"Nintendo ON\", a fake videogame system. It's realistic portrayal caused many gamers, as well as industry insiders, to think it was the real deal.Wii was originally going to launch with an ethernet port in the back, but later switched to Wi-Fi to minimize space.The idea for \"Mii\" dates back to Nintendo's Famicon Disk System, where users could create avatars for themselves in games.WiiWare was actually ready for launch since the console's release in America, but was held back for lack of support.",

    "description": "The Sega Dreamcast is a 128-bit console released in 1998 and the successor to the Sega Saturn. The Dreamcast was based on the powerful Sega Naomi arcade system (released 1998), the successor to the Sega Model 3 arcade system (released 1996). The Dreamcast uses a Hitachi CPU processor, the first with a 128-bit vector graphics engine, along with an NEC GPU graphics processor. It had a new disc format in the shape of the GD-ROM; these discs held up to 1.2 gigabytes of data, considerably more than a Compact Disc. The Dreamcast was Sega's last entry to the console hardware market as their support for the console ended as early as 2001, less than two years after the US launch, and is largely attributed to the arrival of the hotly anticipated and wildly successful PS2. Despite its tragically short life, the Dreamcast is held in high regard by nostalgic fans for the raft of superb exclusive titles released in that time.The Saturn originated in 1995 at the first E3. Since Sony's arrival in the game hardware market, their rivals began playing a major defensive against the juggernaut that was the PlayStation. The growing popularity of the PlayStation brought a lot of support from Japan, and the Saturn began to slip behind in sales. Due to this, Sega began to fear that Sony would gain momentous support in the US and would leave them lagging seriously behind. In order to keep up, Sega made a marketing decision, which has infamously become widely considered to be a historic mistake in its battle for supremacy.At E3, Sega announced that the Saturn was released the same day as the press conference in the US. Their strategy was to release the console early so they could get a strong base before Sony released their console in September. This plan backfired due to the anger of developers and retailers. Many developers were mad because they wanted their games to be released with the Saturn's launch, and many popular retailers (like Wal-Mart and KB Toys) were so angry for lack of information that most considered not selling any more Sega consoles in their stores. The Saturn sold 80,000 units before the PlayStation launched, but the PlayStation sold over 100,000 units during its first week, making Sega's strategy a failure. Even though the Saturn was managing to keep up in Japan, it completely bombed in the US. The only territory where the Saturn had any success was Japan, where it was Sega's most successful console in its home country.Overseas, however, things did not get better for Sega over the next two years. At E3 1997, Bernie Stolar announced \"The Saturn is not our future\". This announcement, for all intensive purposes, killed the Saturn's overseas chances, and made people even more angry because of this. Thus, Sega began work on a new console.The company wanted to create a truly next-generation console, with features ahead of its time and far superior hardware to that of the popular PlayStation as well as the Nintendo 64. As a result, the Dreamcast, based on the powerful Sega Naomi arcade system, was the first console to truly offer arcade-quality 3D graphics, considerably more powerful than any other home system when it launched in 1998.Unfortunately, the desire to get the Dreamcast moving quickly and have a fast production process may have eventually led to its demise, since, as the technology behind it being considerable powerful for a 1998 system, it was far too expensive to produce, forcing Sega to sell it at a loss. In addition, this may have put it at a mid-way point between generations, competing against the much weaker Playstation and N64 in its early years, before eventually competing against the PS2 which had comparable graphical capabilities (though both consoles were weaker than the Xbox and Gamecube by 2001).There were initially two competing models of the Dreamcast. Tatsuo Yamamoto of IBM Austin was to lead a team of eleven developing the \"Black Belt\" version of the console, which was to have a Hitachi SH4 processor and a 3dfx Voodoo 2 graphics chip. At various stages in development, the US model was nicknamed \"Shark\" and \"Dural\". Meanwhile, the Japanese hardware team led by Hideki Sato settled on the same processor, but a PowerVR2 graphics chip created by VideoLogic and manufactured by NEC. This \"White Belt\" version was nicknamed \"Guppy\" and \"Katana\" before the name Dreamcast was decided. The Japanese model was chosen in Summer 1997 because 3dfx had unwittingly leaked its entire contract with Sega in April, who had been keeping the project a secret. 3dfx filed a lawsuit against Sega for breach of contract, but this was settled out of court.On November 27, 1998, The Sega Dreamcast launched in Japan. The console was in high demand throughout the region, causing it to sell out in all stores during its first few weeks of launch. It was selling so well that Sega couldn't keep up with the demand. According to reports, NEC was unable to create enough processors for the Dreamcast so Sega was unable to make as many consoles as they would liked.Seeing how successful the Dreamcast had done in Japan, Sega began work on an American release. Sega of America was hard at work on getting buzz for the American Dreamcast launch. Sega even created their own holiday called \"Dreamcast Day\", set for September 9, 1999, burning 9-9-99 into everyone's memory as the day they'd get to experience the next generation of gaming for the first time. The subsequent European release date was on October 14, 1999.The Dreamcast continued to sell well in North America until 2000. In fact, the Dreamcast even managed to outsell the PS2 in North America in 2000 (possibly due to PS2 shortages), shortly before the console was discontinued. However, this was not enough to resolve the problems Sega were facing, as outlined below.At E3 1999, Sega was showing the Dreamcast and its games to the American market. However, Sega's biggest threat, Sony, unveiled the Playstation 2, showing the complete layout and design of the console. From what Sony showed, it was clear that the Playstation 2 was a more powerful system in comparison to the Dreamcast. Due to this, consumers decided to skip the Dreamcast and wait for the PS2 to come out. These turn of events began to shake the foundation of the Dreamcast.Even though the PS2 had the most attention at that moment, the Dreamcast had a successful launch, selling 300,000 pre-orders, which was more than the original Playstation. The Dreamcast had a vast variety of launch games like Sonic Adventure, Soul Calibur, and NFL 2K. For a while it seemed that Sega would continue to be a competitor in the gaming market.Then in March of 2000, Sony released the PS2 worldwide to considerable hype. One major plus that the PS2 had was the game console doubled as a DVD player. Back then, DVDs weren't popular because standalone DVD players were too expensive for the average consumer. Since the PS2 was less expensive than a stand alone DVD player, the PS2 sold very well and helped boost the DVD platform. There were instances reported where people didn't even buy the console for games (the launch didn't have as many good games as the Dreamcast), and solely used the console for the DVD player functionality. To show support of this, the best selling item for the PS2 in Japan was the Matrix DVD. This made the PS2 look more like an entertainment device than an actual console. Since the Dreamcast couldn't play DVDs, people overlooked the system and Dreamcast consoles were beginning to sit on shelves.One other problem the Dreamcast had was copious amounts of pirating. Because of the Dreamcast's poor copy protection, it was easy for people to copy games onto regular CD-ROM's and have the console recognize them as actual games. Because of this, game sales were decreasing.Despite the considerable hype for the PS2, the Dreamcast in fact managed to outsell the PS2 in North America (possibly due to PS2 shortages) in 2000. However, this was not enough to make up for the losses in both hardware (selling at a loss) and software sales (much of which was being pirated), sealing the fate of Sega.Sega got some relief when Sony was only able to sell half their inventory of PS2 consoles. Since the PS2's inventory was so weak, Sega decided to take action and try to move mass quantities of units. Unfortunately, this plan backfired as well.In March 2001, Peter Moore (the head of Sega of America at the time) announced that the Dreamcast hadn't been meeting expectations. The sales had been sadly lagging and their warehouses were filled with unsold Dreamcast consoles and games. Sega decided to sell off the remaining number of consoles at a vastly discounted price and cut their losses. As part of this restructuring Sega announced that the Dreamcast would be discontinued and that they would exit the hardware business. Furthermore they would also be porting several of their key Dreamcast exclusives to rival platforms.The change was meant to happen slowly with Sega continuing to release software for the system into 2002. However with Sega games now on other platforms third parties weren't all that thrilled to be supporting it. By fall of 2001 the new game output was dismal with only a handful of exclusives, most of which tanked and were never heard from again.Back in 1998, the Dreamcast was an advanced console for its time, surpassing the capabilities of all other consoles available at the time of its release and being the first 128-bit console to be released. The console has 4 controller slots and a 56k modem built into the console for Seganet. A broadband adapter for a faster connection was also available for $50, allowing the Dreamcast to be connected to an ethernet network.Broadband Adapter for the Sega DreamcastThe Dreamcast supported multiple television connections. It shipped with standard A/V cables, and S-video, component RGB cables, and an RF connector were available separately. In addition, Sega released a VGA adapter that allowed the Dreamcast to be played on a computer monitor at a resolution of 640x480, four times the standard resolution. Certain games could not be played through the VGA adapter, however.This console runs GD-Roms which could hold up to 1.2 GBs of space. It also uses VMU memory cards that could hold up to 128 KB of space. These VMUs connect to your Dreamcast controller and have an LCD screen that shows pictures relating to the game that you're playing. For some games, minigames relating to the games are saved onto the VMU which could be played without the use of the Dreamcast, making it a handheld console as well.Samba de Amigo MaracasThe Dreamcast had a lot of accessories. Here's a list of them:VMU Memory CardsRumble PacksVGA Adapter (to play the Dreamcast on your computer screen in 480p)Mouse and keyboardFishing rods (for fishing games)Microphones (for games like Seaman)LightgunsArcade sticks (both single stick controllers for fighting and arcade-style games and a twin stick controller for Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram)CameraMaracas (for Samba de Amigo)Train controls (for a Japanese train simulator)There was supposed to be a MP3 player, DVD player, and Zip drive, but they were canceled due to the discontinuation of the Dreamcast.The Dreamcast was well known for its vast assortment of games, specifically during the launch of the console. For the Sonic fans, there was Sonic Adventure, which was Sega's first successful attempt into bring Sonic's gameplay to 3D. For the fighting fanatics, there was Soul Calibur, which was a 3D fighter (similar to Tekken) that uses swords as their main weapons. This game became a big success, scoring 10's from many game reviewers (IGN and Gamespot) and is considered to be the superior version in comparison to the arcade game. For sports fans, there was NFL 2K, the football title. When EA announced that they would not develop for the Dreamcast due to the failure of the Saturn, this caused Sega to make their own sports titles. NFL 2K was the Dreamcast's answer to Madden and also made other sports titles for the NBA and NHL as well as Virtua Tennis, their own tennis game. Later installments would include online play.Due to a lack of third party support, Sega focused on their first party titles. Sega would continue to release their 2K sports line and would add online play to the 2K1 installments. Sega ported many of their popular arcade games over to the Dreamcast like Crazy Taxi and House of the Dead. Along with their arcade games came their original, innovative titles for the platform. One of them was Samba de Amigo, a rhythm game where you use a controller shaped like Maracas to move your arms around to meet a certain position. Space Channel 5 was another rhythm game where you go around space killing aliens while dancing to pop music. Chu Chu Rocket was a puzzle game where you lead a group of mice away from cats.Although the Dreamcast didn't have a high amount of third party support, the people who did develop for the system released top-notched games. The biggest company to do this was Capcom. Capcom was well known for its fighters released for the Dreamcast. They would make definitive home ports of their popular arcade fighters ( Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and 2) along with releasing brand new fighters exclusive for the console ( Power Stone).The biggest game released for the Dreamcast was Shenmue. It was in development since the Sega Saturn and was made by Yu Suzuki. It was considered to be the most expensive game (costing $70 million) and the most graphically superior game at the time. The game added some new elements like free-roaming gameplay and time-based gameplay. It was hyped to be the killer app for the Dreamcast that would ruin the PS2. When the game was first released in 2001, it came with mixed reviews. Some game reviewers loved the game, giving it 9's and 10's. They consider it a gaming achievement with its deep story and innovative gameplay. Others completely hated the game, giving it low scores. They complained about the slow gameplay and cheesy voice acting. Due to the mixed reviews, the game sold poorly. A sequel was released in Japan for the Dreamcast in 2001, but it never came to the US. In 2002, Sega made a deal with Microsoft to release the sequel for the Xbox in 2002.The Dreamcast was the first console to have fully functioning online play. The system came with a 56K modem and for families who didn't have an ISP Sega created the Seganet service (although players with an ISP already could use their own).Although online play wasn't available untill fall of 2000, players could surf and browse the web through the console from day one. Some games even offered a rudimentry form of downloadable content. In Sonic Adventure, for instance players could download holiday themes for levels.The DreamcastEven though the Dreamcast was discontinued prematurely, the legacy of the console lives on. Due to the Dreamcast failing, Sega had to drop from the console race and begin to make games for other consoles. Most of those games, early on, were ports of Dreamcast games. The two Sonic Adventure games were ported over to the Nintendo Gamecube, which was shocking at the time due to Sega and Nintendo's strong rivalry during the 90s. The Gamecube even got Phantasy Star Online, being one of the only Gamecube games to support online play.Sony, the people whom many claimed to cause Sega to leave the hardware business, got Virtua Fighter 4 for the PS2. Peter Moore, Sega of America's president at the time, left Sega to join Microsoft and help with their new console, the Xbox. Due to him being a part of Sega, he got Sega to make games on the Xbox. They got some exclusive games like Jet Set Radio Future, Panzer Dragoon Orta, and Shenmue II.Many popular Dreamcast games would be later ported to HD platforms such as the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and the PC. In 2011, Sega released the Sega Dreamcast Collection for the Xbox 360 and PC, which brought over Sonic Adventure, Crazy Taxi, Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5: Part 2 with upgraded visuals and rendered at a high-definition resolution. Sega would later release other HD remakes of Dreamcast games such as Sonic Adventure 2 and Jet Set Radio. Sega has also started to bring Dreamcast games over to iOS and Android platforms with the release of Crazy Taxi.Sega continues to make games for current-gen platforms and handhelds and will continue to make games on next-gen platforms such as the Wii U, the Xbox One, and the Playstation 4.The following are Dreamcast's U.S. launch titles released on September 9, 1999.Soul Calibur, Dreamcast Launch TitleBlue StingerMillennium Soldier: ExpendableCART: Flag to FlagThe House of the Dead 2Hydro ThunderMonaco Grand PrixMortal Kombat GoldNFL 2KNFL Blitz 2000Pen Pen Tri-IcelonPower StoneReady 2 Rumble BoxingSonic AdventureSoul CaliburTNN Motorsports Hardcore HeatTokyo Xtreme RacerTrickstyle",

    "description": "The Amiga CD32 was released in September 1993, and it was the first 32-bit cd-rom console to be released in Europe and Canada. Although the plans for releasing it in the US never happened. The Amiga had similar specs as the Amiga 1200 and had the possibility to add mouse, keyboard, etc. It also had a covered expansion slot intended to accomodate a VideoCD playback module. This was eventually utilized by third parties to create other expansion modules that allowed the CD32 to act as a fully capable Amiga computer, first by adding missing ports and later providing for the ability to add a hard drive, memory and upgrade the CPU. The console lasted only for approximately seven months due to component supply issues and therefore it didn't have the sales impact to keep the console alive.However, the console was kept alive in other forms: In the late 1990s to early 2000s, slot machine manufacturer StarGames utilized a stripped down CD32 motherboard in many of their slot machines and in the mid to late 1990s, some vehicle registries in Canada utilized CD32 systems for interactive multimedia testing for drivers license applications.The CD32 also had a unique piece of hardware called the Akiko chip that was added specifically to enable the console to more easily support \"Doom clones\". It provided acceleration for converting the PC's chunky pixel format (which was better suited to the routines that generated the graphics in Doom-like games) to the Amiga's planar pixel format.",

    "description": "Classic Arcade games such as Space Invaders were remade for the 2600The Atari Video Computer System (VCS, renamed 2600 in 1982) is a cartridge-based game console, released in 1977. Atari's prior success with Pong, both in arcades and in the home, lead to the development of the VCS. It was largely successful due home versions of arcade games such as Asteroids, Space Invaders, and Centipede as well as first- and third-party games developed specifically for the console, such as Pitfall and Adventure. The Atari 2600 made the home video game market mainstream, selling 30 million units worldwide before being discontinued in January 1, 1992.The VCS is a second generation 8-bit game console. Video and sound output are handled through an RF modulator; the TV-Game switch. At least 6 different VCS/ Atari 2600 consoles were released, with different aesthetics and placement of the various switches.Video is handled by the 1.19MHz 6607 CPU, with 128 bytes of RAM (thought cartridges could supplement this with 128-256 bytes). The NTSC and PAL versions have somewhat different specifications due to varying video standards - with the NTSC version supporting 128 colors, while the PAL version supports 108.Input is handled through the included single button joystick, or two for multi-player games, and a few games which use them in tandem. Additionally, Atari offered several other input devices. Paddle controllers, consisting of an analogue wheel and a side-mounted button were appropriate for games requiring precise motion on one axis, such as Kaboom! and Breakout. Keypad controllers feature 12 buttons, and can slide-lock into one another. Overlays exist for a few titles (most notably, Star Raiders) which sit atop the keypad controllers. Other, game specific controllers were also offered, such as the driving controller; a paddle variant with 360 degree motion, and a light gun. Third-party hardware manufacturers also offered several controllers. The Atari 2600 launched along with the following 9 games in October 1977:CombatAir-Sea BattleBasic MathBlackjackCombatIndy 500Star ShipVideo Olympics (pong)SurroundStreet RacerIn 1983, the video game market was going into a decline. Atari was getting hit the hardest by this crash- after all, this nightmare was caused partially by Atari itself. The main problem with the 2600 at this time was that its game lineup became overcrowded with bad games. This was mostly because Atari had placed no limitations on who could develop games and how many games could be put out in years or even financial quarters, which is now a mainstay in the video game business first implemented by companies like SEGA and Nintendo. This was around the time that Activision broke off from Atari for more developmental freedom, becoming the first third-party publisher. During 1983, the market was saturated with hundreds of games, with most of them being of poor quality. Since anyone could make games for the Atari 2600, there were all kinds of companies making games who had no place doing so: i.e. cereal and dog food companies, which people would buy and get a refund for later or just ignore. With limited shelf space, retail outlets would eventually stop ordering new software while underselling older products just to make some shelf space. Games were heading into bargain bins, and the games market was going with them.E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failureTwo games are often the scapegoats of The Great Games Crash of 1983: the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man and E.T.. Atari decided to get the exclusive rights to port Pac-Man (the most popular arcade game during the time) to the Atari 2600. This idea looked excellent on paper, but in practice was a dismal failure. The final release of Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 VCS barely resembled what the arcade version was. It was ugly, barely played, and had a sound that would likely haunt your mind to this day if you'd hear it. This version was actually a prototype-a proof of concept with no polish and little developmental time, yet was released anyways. In a rash assumption, Atari printed up more copies than there were Ataris owned, assuming the game would sell systems. The result could not have been more disastrous. Very few copies were sold and Atari was stuck in an awkward financial situation. E.T. was its own disaster. The same sort of hubris occurred and Atari, so sure of itself, pressed too many copies once more. However, the game was of such poor quality that many sold copies of E.T. were returned and refunded. This was such a disaster that it was more cost effective for Atari to simply bury all the copies in a landfill in New Mexico (this was once thought to be only a rumor, but has proven to be true). Atari never truly recovered from this shock.",

    "description": "Sega Saturn Console.The Sega Saturn was released in 1994 in Japan, followed by worldwide release in 1995, and offered gamers 32-bit gameplay. The console was the successor to the Mega Drive (known as the Genesis in North America). Estimates for the Saturn's worldwide sales range from 9.5 million units to 17 million units.Sega developers worked two full years on the Saturn's hardware. At the time, the Saturn was a powerhouse with two CPU's and six more processors. The Saturn was a very complex machine as some of its parts were not designed to work together. The Saturn was originally designed to have a single main processor, with 2D and pseudo-3D graphics similar to the Sega System 32 arcade board and 3D graphics similar to the Sega Model 1 arcade system. However, after learning the 3D capabilities of the new Playstation (in turn influenced by Sega's own AM2-developed Virtua Fighter in the arcades), the Sega Team added a new processor to increase 3D graphical performance.When it came to 2D and pseudo-3D graphical capabilities, the Saturn had the most powerful sprite and background manipulation capabilities of its generation. When it came to 3D polygons, it had more power than the PlayStation but was more difficult to use.Part of the reason for the system's failure was the complex graphics hardware, which was often difficult to work with. Many ports that came to the Saturn were downgraded and completely rewritten. It was also optimised for assembly language rather than the more popular C language, which resulted in the use of C slowing down performance by several times compared to assembly. The Saturn was also mainly designed around quad polygons, for greater compatibility with 2D graphics, rather than triangle polygons, the more popular choice for 3D graphics. As a result of these design decisions, third-party support outside of Japan was very thin for the Sega Saturn.The Sega Saturn was rushed to the Japanese market in November of 1994. As a result of the difficulty to make games for the Sega Saturn, as well as the rushed release, very few games were available at the Saturn's launch. In Japan, the Saturn sold around 170,000 units on launch day. Despite being outsold by the PlayStation, the Saturn's software had more sales than the Playstation's software did at the time. By the end of 1996, the Saturn's hardware sales in Japan were only 600,000 units behind the PlayStation, before the PlayStation pulled ahead in following years (especially after Final Fantasy VII).Despite the PlayStation's lead, the Saturn went on to become Sega's most successful console in Japan, where it was the runner-up and outsold the Nintendo 64. The Saturn's success in Japan was largely due to its large, diverse library of games, most of which were released exclusively in Japan and never made it to Western markets. These included action games such as various Virtua and Street Fighter titles, visual novels such as YU-NO and Machi, and RPG's such as Sakura Wars, Lunar, Grandia, etc.The console's success in Japan was also partly due to Sega's marketing campaign, which largely revolved a new mascot character called Segata Sanshiro (a parody of the classic Akira Kurosawa film & character, Sugata Sanshiro), who was never promoted outside of Japan.Panzer Dragoon Zwei.In North America, the set release date of the Saturn was originally September 2, 1995, one week before the release of the Playstation. This day was called \"Saturnday,\" since September 2 fell on a Saturday that year. However, at E3 in 1995, Sega of America President Tom Kalinske was forced to announce an early release. The new release date was May 11, 1995, a good four months before the Playstation was to be released. This hurt the Saturn far more than it helped it. The Saturn ended up costing $100 USD more than the Playstation, and since most of the Saturn's third-party games were still scheduled to be released at the original launch date, the Saturn had very few launch titles. Many say this was a large factor in the Sega Saturn's eventual failure. The Saturn sold only 80,000 units by the time of the Playstation launch; in contrast, the Playstation sold 100,000 units upon its own launch. As a result of clashes with Sega of Japan about the management of Sega of America, the Saturn launch, and other issues, Tom Kalinske resigned in 1996. Bernie Stolar, Kalinske's replacement, would become a controversial figure after stating at E3 in 1997 that the Saturn was not Sega's future.Meanwhile in Europe, Sega systems had ruled the market since the 1980's. The Master System and Mega Drive (known as Genesis in North America) were the top-selling consoles in Europe. However, when the Saturn was released in Europe in July 1995, the hype for the Playstation's upcoming release led to low Saturn sales there as well. This was the first time Sega had lost its lead in the European market, which it had previously dominated since the 8-bit era.There were many different versions of the console. Sega allowed some companies who helped to make the Saturn to release their own versions of the console. Companies like Hitachi, JVC, and Samsung released their own Saturns with special features. In Japan, there were nine different models made by four different developers. In North America, there were only three models, all of which were made by Sega. In Europe and Australia, there were two models, both made by Sega.By the end of the Saturn's overseas lifespan in 1998, about 470 games had been released. The final games released in 1997 and 1998, most notably Panzer Dragoon Saga, had low production numbers because of the system's impending demise. As a result, these games typically have high prices today, with Panzer Dragoon Saga regularly selling for $200 on eBay. By the end of the Saturn's Japanese lifespan in 2000, the console had nearly 600 games released, a majority of which were exclusive to Japan.The system featured an option for memory expansion. There was a slot behind the CD tray where a storage card could be placed to save high scores, save files, and other data.Saturn Net Link Device.The Netlink modem was a cartridge that fit into the back cartridge slot of the Saturn (where the memory card fit into the system) and ran at a speed of 28.8 kbit/s connection in America and 14.4 kbit/s in Japan. It used a dial-up service, since broadband was unavailable at the time. There were web browsers available for navigating the Internet on the Saturn, but they were not used often. In Europe the Netlink modem was only released in Finland, where it was available with a localized web browser.There were five games that supported the modem:Virtual OnDaytona USA CCE: Netlink EditionSega Rally: Netlink EditionSaturn BombermanDuke Nukem 3DThese games are playable online even today because of the direct-dial support built into the modem. It uses the phone line in any home with the regular phone cable and, in a sense, \"calls\" the other Saturn console, regardless of its location within the same country. Since it uses the phone line, anyone who tries calling that number will be told that it is busy or in use. These games can only be played head-to-head. For its time, this was a large technological advance, especially considering the earlier XBAND service for both the Mega Drive / Genesis and Super Famicom / SNES.The Saturn had an extremely limited launch lineup in America, because developers were uninformed of the surprise launch, and their games weren't ready yet. The following are U.S launch titles for the Sega Saturn released on May 11, 1995:Virtua FighterPanzer DragoonDaytona USADue to Sega's arcade heritage, Sega Saturn has multiple processors for specific operations.

    "description": "By the end of the 90s a new generation of home consoles had arrived and current giant Nintendo wasn't going to get left behind. After outstanding success with the SNES, Nintendo decided it was time to move on to the next generation. They accomplished this by releasing the Nintendo 64 (or N64). The console debuted in Japan on June 23, 1996, North America in September 29, 1996, and in Europe and Australia on March 1, 1997.The console was a big leap from Nintendo's previous consoles as it had a 64-bit processor (hence the name). The NES and SNES had 8-bit and 16-bit processors respectively. The console shipped with Nintendo's flag ship titles: Pilotwings 64 and Super Mario 64, for the first time in history gamers were able to see how Mario looked in 3-D. Like previous consoles ( NES, SNES) the N64 used a cartridge system as opposed to that of its main competitors; the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, which used CDs. This decision to use a cartridge system severely hampered the system's ability to compete with the PlayStation, resulting in a severe loss of market share, and the loss of partner Square-Enix to Sony, which was a large blow to the Nintendo catalog.The Nintendo 64 marked the first time a computer graphics manufacturer Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) developed game hardware technology.Although it didn't sell as well as Nintendo's earlier machines, it marked a history in video games as it was the console that showed gamers how 2D play styles could be adapted into a 3D world with the analog stick, rumble, and built-in 4 player support.The Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's GameCube in November 2001, but the console itself remained in production until its discontinuation in Japan on April 30th 2002, Austrailia on May 11th 2003, Europe on May 16th 2003 and in North America on November 30th 2003.The Nintendo 64 ControllerThe Nintendo 64 featured a unique controller that could be held multiple ways. The three-pronged controller had a center-mounted analog stick, something its competitors Sony and Sega had not implemented yet (though Sega introduced the Sega Saturn's 3-D Controller with an analog stick by the time the N64 hit the market). There was also a traditional directional pad on the left side, and and a set of six face buttons (\"A\", \"B\", and the four\"C-Buttons\") on the right.The game's center handle also featured a trigger on the back, \"The Z Button\". This button was used instead of the \"L\" button in games which used the analog stick.The underside of the controller featured an expansion slot where various accessories could be inserted to enhance gameplay. This trait was replicated on the controllers for Microsoft's Xbox and Sega's Dreamcast.The N64 is famous for having the least amount of games for the launch of any Nintendo console, with three games in Japan and Europe at launch and only two games at launch in the USA. Each launch included the critically acclaimed Pilotwings 64 and Super Mario 64 so most gamers were still happy to buy the console.Pilotwings 64Saikyo Habu ShogiSuper Mario 64Pilotwings 64Super Mario 64Pilotwings 64Star Wars: Shadows of the EmpireSuper Mario 64Nintendo 64 Controller PakDuring the lifespan of the N64, Nintendo released various \"Paks\" used to enhance the console in some way or give it extra functionality.The \"Expansion Pak\" expanded the system’s memory from 4 megabytes to 8. The Expansion Pak was required to play Perfect Dark, Zelda: Majora's Mask and Donkey Kong 64. It was optional in some games, like Turok 2, usually to enable higher resolutions.The \"Transfer Pak\" allowed you to transfer data between the Game Boy and the N64. The Pak plugged into the controller, and the Game Boy game cartridge was inserted into the top of the Pak. The games Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2 relied heavily on this pak, allowing you to transfer Pokemon between games for use in battle.The \"Jumper Pak\" served no real purpose other to eliminate the RAMBUS bus in absence of the expansion pak.The \"Controller Pak\" was a memory card that plugged into the rear of the N64 controller. It was used for game save and option data. N64 games could include a battery save in the cartridge that eliminated the need for a controller pack, but this increased cartridge production costs. As a result, many third-party games did not support cartridge saves and required that players use a Controller Pak to save data.The 'Rumble Pak' was a removable device which went into the back of the N64 controller and which provided force feedback while playing games. Games that supported the ‘Rumble Pak’ vibrated in select situations, such as when shooting weapons or taking damage. It was bundled with Star Fox 64 when it was first released in 1997. Some games that supported the ‘Rumble Pak’ include: Banjo-Kazooie, GoldenEye and Paper Mario. Since the Rumble Pak, force feedback has become an industry standard, and the functionality is now built into current controllers.Nintendo 64DDThe Nintendo 64 Disk Drive was an add-on to the N64 console designed to keep third party developers from making games for a CD based system. It allowed the reading of magnetic disks that were larger in capacity to cartridges and allowed for saving data in them.Although it was heavily hyped even before the system was released, Over time however hype for the add-on signigicly tapered with consumers wondering why to play some hotly hyped games they would have to shell out money for it. Several games intially planned for the 64DD such as Mario RPG 2 (later renamed to Paper Mario) and Zelda Gaiden (Later renamed to Majora's Mask) were instead released on N64 cartridges as opposed to 64DD disks primarily due to the add on being significantly delay.The 64DD was eventually released in Japan in December of 1999, a North American release was planned for 200 however the idea was ultimately canned. Even in Japan it was only sold through Nintendo's subscription based service RANDnet, and not through ordinary stores. The accessory was a commercial failure and only ten games were ever released:F-Zero X Expansion KitPro Golf Tour 64Kyojin no Doshin (Doshin the Giant)Kyojin no Doshin Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou (Doshin the Giant: Tinkling Toddler Liberation Front! Assemble!)Mario Artist: Communication KitMario Artist: Paint StudioMario Artist: Polygon StudioMario Artist: TalentRandnet DiskSimCity 64The rarest of the nine games released on the system is Kyojin no Doshin Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou (Doshin the Giant: Tinkling Toddler Liberation Front! Assemble!) which was last game released after the announcement was made that the Randnet Service would be shutting down and with it the demise of the 64DD.Nintendo 64 Glove Controller.Nintendo released a controller similar to the Power Glove, however this controller could be used for any game, as it had buttons on the top.Although the Nintendo 64 was a commercial success and had some of the most innovative and critically acclaimed games of the time, it could not gain popularity as widespread as the Playstation (especially in Japan) nor did it have a vast array of third-party titles. Thanks to the analog stick on the controller, it brought a new way to play 3D videogames. Many of the games on the console (like Super Mario 64, Golden Eye, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) innovated their genre and brought it over to the 3D world.Thanks to Super Mario 64's 3D gameplay, it started a new trend for free-roaming gameplay and has influenced many series to go in that direction ( Grand Theft Auto, for example). Golden Eye arguably presented the first compelling argument for First Person Shooters on consoles, and was widely lauded for its multiplayer. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is considered by many as one of the best games of that generation (getting perfect 10 scores from many reviewers like IGN and Gamespot). Its 3D free-roaming gameplay revolutionized the adventure genre.The system also introduced several new ideas to the gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 was the first console to introduce a rumble feature to their controller. The Rumble Pak was packaged with Star Fox 64 in 1997. It was a huge leap into getting the player involved in the experience and the feature has been implemented in every controller since then (most notably the DualShock lineup for the Playstation).It also helped a trend to transfer data from handhelds. Although the Super Game Boy was the first accessory to play Game Boy games on the TV, the Transfer Pak was the first to use data from the games and use them in games. Many games like Pokemon Stadium (in which the Transfer Pak was packaged in with) and Pokemon Stadium 2 used the Pokemon games for the Game Boy to transfer your Pokemon over from the game and use them to fight on their console counterparts (you were also able to play the Pokemon games on your TV). This idea was used for many other systems to come like the Gamecube, Wii, Playstation 2, and Playstation 3.The following are the top 10 best selling games for the Nintendo 64. In brackets is the total worldwide sales for the game stated.Super Mario 64 - (11 million)Mario Kart 64 - (8.47 million approx.)GoldenEye 007 - (8 million)Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - (7.6 million)Super Smash Bros. - (4.9 million approx.)Diddy Kong Racing - (4.43 million approx.)Pokemon Stadium - (3.87 million approx.)Donkey Kong 64 - (3.77 million approx.)Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - (3.36 million)Star Fox 64 - (3.32 million approx.)",

    "description": "ColecoVision is a video game console made by Coleco Industries. It was released in August of 1982. It was a home system with arcade type games. It also featured the strange ability to play Atari 2600 games, its competitor. About 120 titles were released for the ColecoVision during its lifespan.The ColecoVision came with the game Nintendo's Donkey Kong as a pack-in game and is revered as a near-perfect arcade port. This increased the popularity of the ColecoVision and by the end of 1982 the ColecoVision had sold 500,000 units. Atari's marketing for a short time claimed the 5200 was more powerful, but ColecoVision did much better than the Atari 5200 in sales, and since the 5200 was based on the Atari 400/800 which was 3 years older, this claim didn't apear to hold much truth. Although the ColecoVision, at the time showed great sales and growth, the Atari 2600 still ruled the roost. The growth of the ColecoVision and the huge install base of the Atari 2600 helped start the first true Multi-platform movement in colsoles. Activision, Parker Brothers, and several other companies for a short time released some titles on near the same launch day for both consoles. The ColecoVision eventually sold more the one million units by 1983.Outside of the United States, the ColecoVision is known as the CBS ColecoVision as it was distributed by CBS Electronics.The ColecoVision was discontinued in 1984 due to the crash of the video game market in 1983.The ColecoVision had three different expansion periphereals:-Expansion Module #1: This allowed the ColecoVision to play Atari 2600 games which largely expanded the ColecoVision game library.-Expansion Module #2: This was a driving controller that came with the pack-in game Turbo. It was only compatible with two other games from the ColecoVision library: Destructor and Dukes of Hazzard.-Expansion Module #3: The ColecoVision's third expansion turned it into a computer called the Coleco Adam. It came with a full keyboard and digital dat pack cassette drives.The primary games of the ColecoVision library were arcade games that Atari had not yet liscensed. The most popular of the ColecoVision games were Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Junior, Carnival, Lady Bug, Mouse Trap, and Zaxxon.",

    "description": "The Intellivision was created by Mattel Electronics and released nationwide in 1980, with Las Vegas Poker & Blackjack as the pack-in game. In late 1982, the pack-in was changed to Astrosmash. Most of the marketing campaign focused on comparing the Intellivision to the Atari 2600, demonstrating the Intellivision's graphical and technological superiority.The console had its cartridge slot on the right side of the system, and the top was utilized for controller storage. The controllers were permanently attached with spiral cords, and featured a numeric keypad, a circular paddle that detected 16 directions, and four rubber buttons on the sides of the controller. Most games came with small plastic overlays that could be inserted into the controller over the keypad, to help players learn and remember game controls. One disadvantage to the controller was its inability to use the disc and keypad inputs at the same time, making \"run & gun\" tactics difficult for games that used the disc for movement and the keypad for firing. The most popular solution to this problem involved using one controller's disc to move and the other controller's keypad to shoot. The controller's side buttons posed another problem, as they were very stiff and unresponsive, making games that utilized them difficult, and extended gameplay painful on thumbs.Although the Intellivision was more powerful, it was never as popular as the Atari 2600, which had more popular games because developers were more interested in exploring the possibilities of the 2600's capabilities. Due to excessive competition in the console market that brought about the \"video game crash\" of 1983, game sales for the Intellivision tanked, and in 1984 Mattel Electronics was shut down by its parent company Mattel. The rights to the Intellivision name brand and its games were eventually bought by INTV Corporation, who made new consoles and introduced new games slowly over time. Production on Intellivision consoles ceased permanently in 1991.The Intellivoice was a peripheral developed by Mattel Electronics in conjunction with General Instruments. It used G.I.'s SP0256 Narrator speech synthesis chip. Released in 1982, the peripheral sold very poorly and as such only 5 games were ever supported.

It was the first Nintendo platform to utilize a touch screen display, and the first since the Game and Watch to utilize two screens.The Nintendo DS features two 3-inch screens positioned vertically in the center of the unit. Every iteration of the console has featured a clamshell design with one screen on either side of the hinge. The bottom screen is a resistive touchscreen, and the system ships with a stylus for use on this screen. The touch screen can register only one point of input at a time.Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection logoEvery version of the DS features a built-in microphone, and games may require players to yell, blow, or talk into the microphone as a type of input. In addition, Wi-Fi capabilities are built into the system through an IEEE 802.11b device. Most online-capable games for the DS are integrated into Nintendo's own Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. This service, introduced in 2005 with Mario Kart DS, is completely free, and focused on providing the user with a simple interface for online gameplay. As of today, there are over 90 games released that are online compatible, and that number is expected to grow to a total of 130 games in the near future.There have been approximately 144.6 DS units sold worldwide as of December 31 2010 (all versions combined). This makes it the second best selling console of all time, behind Sony's PlayStation 2.DSi black and white version side by sideOn October 2, 2008, Nintendo announced that it would be releasing its latest version of the Nintendo DS, the Nintendo DSi. The DSi is 12% thinner than the DS Lite, due to the removal of the GBA slot at the bottom of the system. The screens on the system are slightly larger than those on previous versions at 3.25 inches. The DSi comes with an external 0.3 MP (megapixel) camera and a front-facing camera built into the hinge of the system. The DSi also comes with an SD and SDHC card slot on the side and has 256 MB flash memory built in.Nintendo also launched the DSi Store, which carries DSiWare games and software. The store uses the renamed Nintendo Points, 1000 of which came free with the DSi until March 2010, and content is priced at 0, 200, 500, or 800 points. Nintendo Points cards can only be used for one platform at a time, and Points from a single card cannot be shared between the two platforms.Nintendo Points CardThe DSi launched in Japan on November 1st, 2008 for ¥18,900 ($178). It was released in Europe on April 3rd, and in the Americas on April 5th for $169.99.Nintendo has also updated the DS interface menu to accommodate new software. Users were Initially able to access the following programs from the main menu: DSi Camera, DSi Sound, DSi Shop, PictoChat, and download play, although this has been improved upon. The menu also includes icons for starting a game from a DS cartridge and accessing system settings.The Nintendo DSi comes with a free Web Browser made by Opera which uses built-in RAM, a more efficient alternative to the DS add-on web browser, which came with RAM that went into the GBA port.The DSi's menu is based on the Wii Channel interface. Users will be able to add new programs that will be listed on the screen.At GDC 2009, DSi project leader Matsato Kuwahara revealed that the company will be releasing two different kinds of DS cartridges. \"DSi Cards\" will only work with the DSi itself, while \"DSi Enhanced Cards\" will work with all DS systems, with extra features when used with the DSi. This strategy will allow developers to take advantage of DSi-specific features. Cartridges can now be hot swapped in and out of the DSi system while it is powered on.The DSi has two VGA (0.3 megapixel) cameras, one on the inner hinge andDSi's cameraone on the outer shell. Photos can be saved to an SD card, shared wirelessly between two DSis, or uploaded to a central server.The camera is also included in some game elements. Among the features are a facial blending tool, a method for changing facial expressions, and a means of measuring similarity between two faces. The camera itself can be set to take photos in a various modes, including normal mode, \"trick\" mode, and frame mode.Selecting DSi Sound from the menu opens a mini music player, complete with a variety of visualizers and audio tools, including recording and editing capabilities.Unfortunately, those looking for MP3 support are out of luck, as DSi Sound will only support AAC format.The DSi XL has louder speakers due to more holes in the system.Comparison of the DSi (left) and DS Lite (right), showing off the larger screens, camera and new power lightsDSi XL: March 28, 2010DSi: April 5, 2009DS Lite: June 11, 2006DS: November 21, 2004DSi XL: 314 gDSi: 214 gDS Lite: 218 g (21% lighter than DS)DS: 275 gDSi XL: 161 mm * 91.4 mm * 21.2mm / 6.4 in * 3.6 inDSi: 137 mm * 74.9 mm * 18.9 mm / 5.4 in * 3 in * 0.74 in (12% smaller than DS Lite)DS Lite: 133 mm * 73.9 mm * 21.5 mm / 5.24 in * 2.9 in * 0.85 in (42% less volume than DS)DS: 148.7 mm * 84.7 mm * 28.9 mm / 5.85 in * 3.33 in * 1.13 inDSi XL: 4.2 in.DSi: 3.25 in.DS Lite: 3.0 in.DS: 3.0 in.DSi XL: up to 17 hoursDSi: up to 14 hours, 8-12, 6-9, 4-6, 3-4 (840 mAh)DS Lite: up to 19 hours, 10-15, 7-11, 5-8 (1000 mAh - Reduced battery life after 500 charges)DS: up to 10 hrs (850 mAh)DSi XL: 3 hoursDSi: 2 hours 30 minutesDS Lite: 3 hoursDS: 4 hoursDSi XL: Five levels of brightnessDSi: Five levels of brightnessDS Lite: Four levels of brightness: no off in main menuDS: Two levels of brightness: on and offDSi XL: 129.3mmDSi: 92 mmDS Lite: 87.5 mm * 4.9 mm (side-loaded on the right, just below power switch)DS: 75.0 mm * 4.0 mmDSi: NoneDS Lite: NoneDS: Wrist strap (Japan: Thumb Stylus)DSi: D-pad and Start Select A B Y X buttons same position as DS Lite, but sit slightly lower.

    "description": "The PC Engine CD-ROM² add-on was released in Japan for the PC Engine console in December of 1988. The North American version, known as the TurboGrafx-CD, went on sale in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16 (the North American version of the PC Engine).While it had little success in North America, the device boosted sales for the PC Engine in Japan. It helped the PC Engine outsell the NES for a while (up until the release of the SNES) and become the second best-selling console of the 16-bit era, behind the Super Famicom (which later planned its own PlayStation CD add-on) and ahead of the Sega Mega Drive (which later had its own CD-ROM add-on, the Sega CD).This device was the first system to introduce the CD-ROM format (which was officially released by Sony and Philips just months before its release), predating the FM Towns computer by a couple of months and the Sega CD console add-on by several years. The platform would see a full redesign in 1991 (October 1992 in North America) as the PC Engine Duo, or TurboDuo. The Duo console merged the card-playing base console an CD-ROM add-on into one piece of hardware.Initially, playing CD-ROM games on a TG16 required the use of a System Card, which carried the BIOS data required to properly access the TGCD hardware. When the Duo was released, an updated version of this firmware was included in the console itself, booting whenever the system was powered-up without a card inserted into the card slot. The firmware released with the Duo was upgraded to allow the platform to play \"Super CD\" releases. Owners of the existing, non-Duo version of the platform were forced to purchase a new system card (the \"Super System Card\") to play these new discs. In Japan, one further upgrade, known as the Arcade Card, was released. Only a handful of games (known as \"Arcade CDs\") were released that require the Arcade Card upgrade. The Arcade Card was not released outside of Japan.Discs released for the TGCD hardware are region-free and can be booted on any version of the PC Engine hardware, assuming that the appropriate system card is present. Both the Duo models and the TGCD add-on have built-in memory, allowing players to save progress and scores in supported titles. By pressing Select at the system's boot screen, a data management screen can be accessed.An online modem was also planned for the console in Japan, in order to compete with the online services of the Nintendo Famicom and Sega Mega Drive (and later the Super Famicom), but it was eventually cancelled.As the first system to use the CD-ROM format, it introduced several new features to home video games, including a very large amount of storage space (540 MB of data, in contrast to the 1 or 2 MB cartridges of that era), cinematic cutscenes and voice acting (both previously limited to laserdisc arcade games, i.e. interactive movies), and CD-quality Red Book audio (a huge improvement over the chiptune audio of previous home systems). Some of the first home video games to demonstrate these features include No-Ri-Ko (1988), Far East of Eden: Ziria (1989), and Ys I & II (1989).Full-motion animation was not used as frequently in early games for the TGCD, this being before the \"multimedia gaming\" era that the Sega CD and the 3DO fell into. The cinematics in the games were usually more anime-like in nature (and rendered in-engine), which served to partially hide the limitations of the unit's single-speed CD drive, with some of the most beautiful cutscenes being present in games like Ys Book I & II, Ys III and IV, Far East of Eden, Cosmic Fantasy 2, and a remake of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier. The system was more widely supported in its native country of Japan, which received a much larger library of games for the device than North America did.Today, the system is primarily known in North America as a home for quality shoot-'em-ups, like Lords of Thunder, Gate of Thunder, R-Type Complete CD, and more, as well as for RPG's with cinematic cutscenes and CD-quality audio soundtracks (such as the early Ys games, for example).

It was created by Bandai, and the successor to the original WonderSwan. In Japan, it was met with modest success and sales (especially considering Nintendo's near-monopoly of the handheld market). The market share of the WonderSwan Color was approximately 8%, according to Bandai. Much of this success is credited to the low price of the handheld; ¥6800, or $59. The WonderSwan Color also had great third party support, with companies such as Squaresoft (who ported many of the original Final Fantasy games to the WonderSwan Color). When the WonderSwan Color's successor, the SwanCrystal, was released, Nintendo had regained support of Squaresoft, however. One of the unique features of the WonderSwan (all versions) was the fact that it could be played either horizontally or vertically. The WonderSwan Color bundled with Final Fantasy.The original WonderSwan featured only black and white. Naturally, the WonderSwan Color had a color LCD screen (as well as several more upgrades). The WonderSwan Color is slightly larger (7 mm larger) and heavier (2 g heavier), contained more RAM (64k of RAM). The WonderSwan Color is backwards compatible with many of the original WonderSwan's game (as well as the WonderSwan being compatible with many of the WonderSwan Color's games).Similar to the Nintendo DS, before the WonderSwan Color can be used, the player must enter data about oneself, including birth date (year, month, and day), name, sex, and blood type. The name appears under Bandai's logo whenever the handheld console is turned on. The WonderSwan Color launched in several colors (five, in fact): Pearl Blue, Crystal Pink, Crystal Black, and Crystal Orange. In addition, several limited editions of the console were released.

    "description": "NEC's TurboGrafx-16 consoleThe TurboGrafx-16 is a fourth generation, 8/16-bit video game console manufactured by Nippon Electric Company (NEC), with the assistance of Hudson. It is known in Japan as the PC Engine and was released in Japan on October 30, 1987. It was released in North America on August 29, 1989, and was released in a very limited manner in Europe in 1990. The console is known as the PC Engine Plus in the UK (where many gamers preferred importing the Japanese PC Engine instead) and as simply the TurboGrafx elsewhere in Europe.Games were distributed on HuCards, which are roughly the size of a credit card and about twice as thick; similar to the Sega Card used by the Master System. The original TurboGrafx-16 console included one TurboPad controller, and the pack-in title: Keith Courage in Alpha Zones. The TurboGrafx-16 was the first (and only) major console release by any company to include a multifire (turbo)-capable controller. The TurboStick, an arcade-style controller; and the TurboTap, a 5-player multitap, were also offered.A large expansion port at the rear of the console is hidden under a removable plastic cover. The optional TurboBooster accessory attaches to the expansion port, and boosts the system's video RAM, while provisioning the system for composite video output, and stereo sound. This was a fairly novel feature at release.The TurboGrafx-16 was the first console to be marketed as a 16-bit console, though it is debatable whether it qualifies as a 16-bit console. While the central CPU of the TG-16 is 8-bit, the dual GPU processor setup and graphics card is 16-bit, and can display 482 colors at once out of a 512 color palette. It was the first console that came reasonably close to arcade-quality graphics, approaching that of a mid-range arcade machine at the time. Its 8-bit CPU was also faster than the 16-bit CPU of the SNES, though not the Mega Drive.While often not considered a \"true\" 16-bit console due to its use of an 8-bit CPU, the PC Engine technically surpassed both of its true 16-bit rivals, the Mega Drive (released 1988) and SNES (released 1990), by the end of the 16-bit era, due to expansions such as the Super CD-ROM and Arcade Card in Japan providing greater storage capacity and RAM memory.The PC Engine was very popular in Japan, where NEC had already been dominating the personal computer market with the PC-88 and PC-98 platforms. By 1988, it had outsold Nintendo's Famicom, becoming Japan's console leader until the Super Famicom's release in 1990. Meanwhile, the PC Engine continued to outsell the Sega Mega Drive in Japan throughout the 16-bit era.The console's success in Japan was partly due to NEC's strong presence in the personal computer market, with the PC-88 and PC-98 systems dominating the country's computer market for nearly two decades.The PC Engine was also smaller than its later TurboGrafx counterpart released in North America. The PC Engine was about the same size of a packet of crisps, making it the smallest console ever released up until then.The console's success was mainly due to the PC Engine CD-ROM peripheral, which allowed greater storage space, more RAM, and higher audio quality, than rival consoles. It had a very large library of CD-ROM games released exclusively in Japan.TurboGrafx CDThe TG-16 was released in North America with a CD-ROM peripheral that cost about $400 USD. It was called the TurboGrafx-CD. This was the first home gaming peripheral in the US to use CD's. The debut titles of the TG-CD were popular, but the TG-CD library grew slowly compared to the TG-16 HuCards.Despite slow CD growth, the PC Engine CD-ROM peripheral had a very large library of CD-ROM games that were released almost exclusively in Japan, including gems such as Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. However, because most of these titles were never localized for the US, the US library size for the TG-CD was eclipsed by the later released Sega CD, despite the Sega CD's library being significantly smaller than the PC Engine CD-ROM's library in Japan.After the US release of the TurboGrafx-16, NEC got cold feet upon seeing the sales numbers and decided to cancel their planned European releases. All of the stock planned for release in Europe - US systems poorly modified to run on PAL televisions - was instead sold to various distributors to handle themselves.The UK's allotment of consoles was bought up and handled by Telegames, who elected to sell the console via mail-order as the Turbografx. Telegames reportedly found supporting the system difficult, as PAL consoles would no longer be manufactured, resulting in limited supplies.In France, the system was imported and sold without license by Sodipeng (Société de Distribution de la PC Engine), a subsidiary of Guillemot International, a hardware distribution firm founded by the same people as Ubisoft.Most early games relied on the console's 2 KB internal memory to save data; this was the first time game saves could be stored internally within a console. The TurboDuo later increased the internal memory for save data to 192 KB. An additional device to store save data was also released, the Memory Base 128. This was the first device to allow game saves to be stored externally from the console or games themselves.A modem expansion was also intended for the Japanese market, to compete with the online services of the Famicom and Mega Drive (and later the Super Famicom). The project was eventually cancelled, however.The TurboGrafx-16 was also the first console to feature a multitap adaptor, which allowed up to five players to play at the same time, in titles such as the 5-player co-op action RPG tile Dungeon Explorer. The PC Engine Multitap, released in 1987, was the first multitap peripheral for a console, setting a template for later multitap peripherals such as the Super Multitap and PlayStation Multitap.The TurboExpress / PC Engine GT handheld system was released in 1990 for $249.99. It plays all HuCards on a backlit color LCD screen, with a typical 3-hour battery life on a set of 6 AA batteries. The size of the screen was an issue on text-heavy games, as games were designed to have legible text on larger TV sets. The $249-$299 retail price proved to be too high for all except the most well-heeled gamers, and accessories like the TurboVision (a TV tuner) weren't enough to help the TurboExpress ever gain wide acceptance. Though unpopular, TurboExpress was ahead of its time for a handheld, as the most powerful console of its era, playing the same games as the full console. The Sega Nomad accomplished a similar goal (playing Mega Drive / Genesis carts on a portable) five years later.In 1991, the PC Engine LT was released in Japan, with a new case design that resembles the later Game Boy Advance SP and Nintendo DS.NEC released the Arcade Card expansion in 1994. It greatly increased the system's RAM, giving it up to 2304 KB of memory. The Arcade Card expansion, however, was never released in the U.S.Despite having an 8-bit CPU, the Arcade Card's increased memory allows its graphical quality to greatly exceed its 16-bit rivals, the Super Famicom and Sega Mega Drive, though not quite as advanced as the more expensive Neo Geo. The increased memory also allows full-motion video at a much higher quality than the Sega CD.The TG-16 was marketed as a 16-bit console, but struggled against its competition since it was an 8-bit/16-bit hybrid. It also struggled in North America because many big developers supported the PC Engine, but also made games primarily for Nintendo. Nintendo's licensing policies of the day made developers sign exclusivity agreements with them to ensure games on the NES would not be ported to other consoles. Nintendo said at the time this was to ensure there would not be another crash of the video game market like 1984. This made it all but impossible for the TG-16 to import well-known franchises for its limited American audience.In October of 1992, NEC partnered with Hudson Soft to release the TurboDuo. Essentially, a TG-16 combined with the Turbo CD system. It also had system BIOS upgrades and an additional 192k of RAM built in. It was initially sold for $299. At the same time a Super System card was released for $60. It contained the new BIOS and additional RAM for owners of the original TG-16 and CD-ROM to play the updated games. The Duo (as it was shortened to) and the Super System Card also failed to gain much ground and was another disappointment in the US market. According to Gamepro.com, the TurboGrafx-16 is the #9 worst-selling game console of all time, at least in North America.CPU processor: 8-bit Hudson HuC6280A (based on MOS 6502) at 7.6 MHz Performance: 3.3 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processors: Dual 16-bit Hudson GPU setup Video Display Controller (VDC) chip: HuC6270A (2x with SuperGrafx)Video Color Encoder (VCE) chip: HuC6260Color palette: 9-bit (512 colors)Maximum colors on screen: 482Maximum sprites on screen: 64 (128 with SuperGrafx)Screen resolution: 256x224 - 512x242 (most commonly 256x239)Possible AV outputs: RF, CompositeSound CPU: HuC6280A also used to program/control sound6 channel wavetable at 3.58 MHz, PSG (programmable sound generator)5-10 bit stereo PCMLFO (low frequency oscillation), noise generation, DAC (digital-analog converter)TurboGrafx-CD expansion Sound chip: Oki MSM5205 ADPCM chipSound DRAM memory: 128 KB (64 KB for samples, 64 KB for code and data)Audio formats: ADPCM, CD-DA, Red BookRAM memory Main RAM memory: 8 KBVideo RAM (VRAM) memory: 64 KB (128 KB with SuperGrafx)Additional RAM expansions: 64 KB (TurboGrafx-CD), 256 KB (TurboDuo), 2304 KB (Arcade Card)Game storage: HuCard: Up to 2.5 MBCD-ROM: 540 MB (requires TurboGrafx-CD)Save data: Internal memory: 2 KB (base), 192 KB (TurboDuo)Additional memory: Memory Base 128 device20 Years of Turbo Power, 1UPFeature: The Making of the PC Engine, Nintendo LifeTurboGrafx-16 101: The Beginner's Guide, Racket Boy",

    "description": "A Yellow Game Boy ColorThe Game Boy Color was Nintendo's second handheld video game console, and the successor to the Game Boy. It was released on November 19, 1998 in North America, on October 21, 1998 in Japan, on November 23, 1998 in Europe, and in 1999 in Australia. Unlike its predecessor, it featured a color screen. It was smaller than the original Game Boy, but slightly larger than the Game Boy Pocket. The Game Boy Color only used 2 AA batteries as compared to the originals 4, and the Game Boy Pocket's 2 AAA's. Combined sales of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color were charted at 118.69 million worldwide. Total Sales for Japan reached 32.47 million units, 44.06 million in the the Americas, and 2.16 million in other regions.The Game Boy Color was originally a response by Nintendo from the pressure of developers for new and more sophisticated hardware. Developers felt that the Game Boy, and even the recently released Game Boy Pocket, were far too simple and stifled creative ability. To combat this, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color. The Game Boy Color was the first handheld video game console to be backwards compatible, meaning that original Game Boy games could be played on it. This has since become a standard in the Game Boy line. The Color boasted a processor twice as powerful as its predecessor, as well as four times the available system memory. This allowed for developers to create much larger and longer games than possible with the original systems specifications.Many games released during the Game Boy Color's run were developed to be still be compatible with the older Game Boy classic and Game Boy Pocket. Cartridges that were backwards-compatible with the older hardware kept the traditional Game Boy cartridge shape, but were colored black instead of the traditional gray. Games exclusive to the Color, however, were released in a clear cartridge with a bulging extraction grip, as opposed to the traditional indented one.Dragon Warrior MonstersHexcitePocket BowlingTetris DXWario Land IICentipedeGame & Watch Gallery 2Pocket BombermanTetris DXTetris DXGame and Watch Gallery 2CentipedePocket BombermanProcessor - Similar to the Z80, manufactured by Sharp with some bit manipulationClock Speed - 8 MHzMemory - 32 kilobytes of system RAM, 16 kilobytes of video RAMScreen Resolution - 160x144 pixelsColors - 56 simultaneously onscreen from a palette of 32,768 colorsSeveral different colors of the system was produced, many being limited or special editions.Pokémon editionBerryGrapeKiwiDandelionTealAtomic PurplePokémon Gold/Silver editionPokémon editionPokémon Center editionHello Kitty edition (Japan only)Clear (Japan only)Clear blackClear green (Japan only)Midnight blueIce blueClear orange (Japan only)Clear blueTommy Hilfiger EditionThe Game Boy Color featured an extremely robust library.

    "description": "The One and Only Commodore 128By late 1984 the need for Commodore Business Machines (CBM) to make a successor to the Commodore 64 was mounting. Following the absolute failure of the Commodore Plus/4 line, and the Commodore Amiga struggling in the midst of growing market competition as well as an anemic marketing campaign by Commodore the need for a new and more successful line of Commodore computers on par with the Commodore 64 (C64) was apparent. However things were quickly becoming more and more difficult for Commodore management to design and market a new computer. Firstly CBM was dealing with a management crises following the loss of the visionary, albeit controversial, Jack Tramiel and his ascension to the top position at Atari (CBM’s prime competitor following Apple and IBM). With that the new management lacked the vision and business experience that allowed Tramiel to make CBM the dominate force in the PC market. Couple this with increased market competition CBM was quickly loosing its market dominance in the personal computer market. Companies such as Apple, IBM, and Atari were quickly making a dent in CBM's foothold. As such financially CBM was not on the solid ground that it was accustomed to.It was under these troubled circumstances that Commodore Business Machines decided to invest the money to design and market the Commodore 128 (C128). In doing so they had hoped to regain their foothold in the personal computer market and finally restore their dominance from back when the C64 had first debuted.Bill Herd, the Mastermind Behind the C128.The design of the C128 was the brainchild of computer engineer Bil Herd. A young and up and coming engineer Bil Herd had quickly ascended to the Lead Engineering position in Commodore for his vocal and vehement criticism of the Plus/4 management team. From the start Herd learned from the Plus/4 line’s greatest mistake and made full compatibility with C64 software a feature in the C128 from the start. As such it could play any cartridges intended for the C64 and could understand any code programmed in older versions of Commodore Basic.One of the most important aspects of the C128’s design was the fact that it utilized multiple central processing units to allow for multiple applications. The C128 had two CPUs: a 2 MHz MOS 8502 processor and a 4 MHz Zilog Z80A processor. While the C128 had multiple processors this does not mean that it was a true multiprocessor as the C128 was unable to utilize both processors simultaneously. There was a reason for this. Lead engineer Herd used the MOS processor to run the C64 and C128 mode whereas the Zilog processor ran the CP/M mode. CP/M was a popular operating system specifically designed for business functions and applications. In the minds of Commodore’s management team by having business functions integrated into the C128 allowed for them to market the C128 as a versatile all purpose PC. In order to boot up this mode a user was required to insert a CP/M boot up disk. However a consequence of this design meant that the C128 was an expensive and complex computer to manufacture.The C128 Basic Start Up ScreenAs for the specifications for the C128 it was an improvement across all boards in comparison to the C64. It had an MOS 8563 integrated circuit which had 16 colors and used an improved SIDs chip which was capable of 4 waves. It also had an impressive amount of RAM for a computer at the time. However getting to this point proved to be a difficult and costly experience for everyone involved in Commodore. The multiple processor design led to many issues that Bil Herd’s engineering team struggled to deal with. Many prototypes (even in the later design stage) had the catastrophic tendency to catch on fire or explode. Not only was that but the yield on their video cards was extremely low for their prototypes (as low .01%). Due to facing many processor bugs the production was delayed and expensive and the engineering team barely made CES 1985 reveal.A Marketing Poster Directed at the Apple IIThe technical complexity of the C128 not only led to engineering issues but also marketing issues. The idea of a computer being a multi-functioning unit was still a new concept for the PC market as many consumers still owned or used specialized business computers for work and simple computers for home. Despite the versatility of the C128 CBM believed that marketing the C128 to the business computing market would be the most fruitful. However this deprived the C128 the mass appeal that allowed for the C64 to become the best selling computer in the mid eighties. By denying the C128 from becoming a gaming platform Commodore management also prevented it from being marketed as the “family” system that had really also allowed for the C64 to gain the mass appeal that made it the system seller and encouraged video game development for the computer. Also worth noting was that while it was present, the marketing campaign for the C128 was anemic and an all around weak effort by all accounts on the part of CBM management. Due to management not having the energetic driving force that Jack Tramiel provided during his time at the company the marketing was unable to really grab the attention of consumers like the C64 did.Despite the fact that the C128 was an expensive computer to manufacture Commodore was fearful that if they were to price the C128 too high it would encroach on the Amiga’s high end personal computer market. As such the C128 was priced at $299.95 and the improved and updated 128D was priced at $499.95. This was despite the fact that it cost as much to manufacture as the Amiga 500 which was priced at $595.95. This meant that Commodore was marketing an under-priced graphical power-horse to businesses and families that didn’t need the multitasking or applications that the C128 had. It should be noted that the business computer market and family computer market were already inundated with cheap albeit more specialized varieties. As a result by being a mismarketed jack of all trades the C128 failed to appeal to any one market.As for video game developer support for the C128, it was a lack luster affair. Part of the reason for this was that the C128 was design specifically with the business market in mind and with the gaming scene as an afterthought. In total less than 50 games were released for the C128. In comparison to the C64 having over 10,000 commercial software titles published for it (over 2,000 which were video games), a significant failure for the C128. Similarly whereas the C64 and to a greater extent the Amiga where able to carve an active demo scene in the computer hobby world no such support would develop for the C128.The C128 Retail PackageIn total by the end of its production the C128 sold around four million units. While by no means a failure in comparison to the C64’s approximately 17,000,000 sold the C128’s market performance came as a disappointment to the management team at Commodore. As previously noted due to the C128’s low price Commodore Business Machines received a lower than usual profit per unit when C128s were initially being sold. Also worth noting is that the C128 was seen as the last computer that utilized CP/M. In less than a year after it was released CP/M use was being replaced by major businesses in favor of Microsoft DOS. As such Commodore’s hope that they would carve out a base in the business computer market completely failed.The disappointing performance of the C128 as well as the Amiga line struggling to maintain dominance marked the beginning of the end for Commodore Business Machines. While the company was once the manufacturer of the most popular line of personal computers in the United States and worldwide their management struggles and inability to deal with the changing personal computer market would market the death note for CBM. This machine would be Commodores' last 8-Bit computer; after this they would produce only 16/32 bit Amiga's and IBM PC clones. Five years following the discontinuation of the C128 line CBM would file for bankruptcy and sell the Amiga line to German PC manufacturer Escom.",

With the new CD format SNK could release home conversions of their arcade releases for a more reasonable price point at about $50-$60. Unfortunately, the Neo Geo CD had it's own problems, most notably load times that regularly lasted several minutes.

    "description": "Odyssey 2In 1976 Fairchild Electronics  rocked the video game industry with its invention of the ROM cartridge which was utilized in their video game console The Channel-F. The technological innovation lead to an increase amount of diversity in the video game industry in the form of videos games and the consoles that played them. However with innovation came adoption and after the release of the Channel F Atari came up with the Atari VCS (later renamed the Atari 2600).    However caught in the middle of all of this was the Magnavox reeling from the success of their non-programmable console the Odyssey. However by the time the Channel F and Atari 2600 had been released Magnaovx had already begun designing a new non-programmable console that would succeed the Odyssey. Forced to make an important decision Magnavox scrapped the design in favor of a cartride capable console in a darring attempt to break out of the over saturated dedicated console market. With expectations that technology would lead the console to sucess Magnavox released the Odyssey 2 with high expectations in 1978The console that was released in 1978 differed greatly from the console Magnavox originally had invisioned. Firstly it was a programable console capable of utilizing ROm cartridges. Also the Odyssey 2's CPU could utilize background music scoring, better graphics, as well as better gameplay when compared to its predecessor. The Magnavox designers also want to differentiate their from their competition in the form of how players actually palyed their game. Firstly unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey 2 also included a full alpha-numeric touch pad keyboard. This lead to a small active group of developers for the console to design educational games for the console which would go onto to be a marketed selling point for the console.For hand held controllers, the Odyssey 2 utilized the classic joystick design of the 1970s and 80s:  A moderately sized, self centering eight way joystick.  It was held in the left hand, and manipulated with the right hand.  In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button.  A credit to the designers at Magnavox, three or four years later, with Atari, Intellivision, and a number of third party companies producing hardware, many people still felt that the Odyssey 2 joystick was one of the best designed.While by no means a failure the Odyssey 2 had failed to really catch on the way other consoles had at the time. By the early 80's The landscape for video game consoles had greatly changed. Atari had gain a significant foothold on the market. Fairchild had left only to be replaced by Intellivision and (latter) Colecovision. While the sales of these consoles grew greatly as months and years passed by usership of the Odyssey 2 had remained stagnant. Nevertheless various developers refused to drop support for the console. Developers such as Philips kept on supporting the Odyssey 2 well until the death of the console.  With a slow but steady stream of of games being released for the console as well as a child and educational friendly image the console sold around one million units in the United States.  Video Pac Game Leaflet As for overseas sales the Odyssey 2  started the unusual trend (i.e. Sega Master System)  of consoles that did poorly in the States that going onto be suprise successes in other overseas markets.Part of the reason for this was that the European release for the console was marketed and planned out by Magnavox's parent company and electronics giant Philips Electronics.  In Europe (and in other parts of the world as well) the Odyssey 2 was sold as the Philips G7000 Videopac console. In France, it was known as the Philips C52.  In Brazil it was known as the Odyssey, as the original Odyssey was never released in Brazil.

    "description": "The TRS-80 is a desktop microcomputer put out by Tandy Corporation which was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. TRS stands for Tandy Radio Shack, and the system is affectionately known as the \"Trash 80\" by fans. The microcomputer had important features such as a full keyboard, included monitor, well written floating point BASIC programming language, and a $600 price point. The computer was released in 1977, a couple years before Atari made games a driving factor for computer sales. As such, the TRS-80 was not generally a gaming platform and many games available for it use ASCII graphics or are simple text adventures. Sound was difficult to program, as was just about anything, so games with sound, such as Ball Turret Gunner, displayed it proudly on the box. The TRS-80s gaming problems were mostly fixed with the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo) line which launched 3 years later. As the line progressed through the late 80s, Tandy faded into obscurity as Commodore and Atari edged out ahead in gaming capability.CPU - Zilog Z80 1.77 MHz processorMemory - 4 Kb / 16KbVideo - 128 x 48 resolution, monochrome TV monitor as displayAudio - NoneMedia - Cassette tapes via built in drive, floppy disk via expansionBuilt-in Language - BASIC Level I / BASIC Level IIKeyboard - QWERTY layout with 53 full-stroke keysOS - TRSDOSIO Ports - Monitor, cassette interface, expansion portThe TRS-80 was released as a fully loaded microcomputer with a cassette drive, monitor, and keyboard. The basic model included a mere 4KB of RAM, while later models shipped with 16KB.Data from the keyboard was read in a rather strange way on the TRS-80. The keys were mapped to pre-defined locations in memory and the computer would poll these locations to get the current state of the keyboard. The keyboards of the original TRS-80 models were generally regarded as poor as suffered from \"keyboard bounce\" which would result in duplicate letters accidentally being typed. To correct this problem, keyboard de-bounce software was distributed which made sure the keyboard wasn't polled too rapidly. This software was later build into the machine.Early TRS-80 models used a black and white RCA TV as a monitor, while later models switched to a more pleasant black and green. The TRS-80 could not display true, bitmap graphics, but instead used a subset of ASCII characters called semigraphics. The display featured 64 character columns with 16 character rows, and graphical software used ASCII characters and semigraphics. Semigraphics were characters formed as a grid of 2x3 blocks filled in 64 different ways. The 2x3 grid characters mapped out over the whole 64x16 display gave a virtual resolution of 128x48, all done with ASCII characters and semigraphics.Programs were usually stored on cassettes, read by the built-in cassette drive. The tape deck included was just a standard monaural deck and the user had to manually set the volume while loading a program. If the volume was not correct while loading, the user would have to rewind, adjust the volume, and attempt to load again. Models with BASIC Level I read/wrote data at 25 bytes/sec, while models with BASIC Level II read/wrote data at 50 bytes/sec. No hardware controller existed for loading or storing data; the sounds were created electronically by switching the CPU voltage rapidly from negative to positive and back causing a click. Clicks were registered as 1s in the bit stream, while a silence was 0.The TRS-80 expansion interface was an expensive but very useful option add-on that added a variety of features. They added 16k or 32k RAM, a second tape unit connector, a floppy disk controller, a printer port, a serial port, and a real time clock. The expansion interface was troublesome and was a leading cause of system crashes and lock-ups for a variety of reasons.In 1977, Tandy released the $599 Radio Shack TRS-80 around the same time as the Apple II and Commodore PET. It used a black and white RCA TV for a monitor, without a tuner. The Model Is were notorious for causing RF interference, so much so that some games were set up to output sound to an AM radio. The FCC eventually found the Model Is didn't comply with regulations and they were replaced with the Model III. Early Model Is had problems reading tapes from the cassette deck. The ROM was later modified to correct this, but users could get the problem fixed at a service center by having a small PCB installed.The TRS-80 Model II was a business model released in 1979, and was completely different from the Model I. It featured a Zilog Z80A processor running at 4mhz, a Shugart 8\" floppy drive, and an 80x24 monitor. The keybaord was detachable and it came with a standard printer port and 2 serial ports. Up to 4 floppy drives could be connected to one computer, each floppy holding 500k of data compared to the 87k of a Model I disk. The Model II used the TRSDOS-II operating system which made it largely incompatible with Model I software, and is thus considered a rather obscure TRS-80 model.The Model III is the successor to the Model I and was released in 1981. It featured two 5.25\" floppy drives that could convert Model I disks since difference in ROM made a few programs incompatible. The Model III also featured a better keyboard, build-in lowercase letters, and a faster processor: a Zilog Z80A running at 2.03mhz.The Model 4, released in 1983, includes two 5.25\" drives, a 4mhz Zilog Z80 processor, and had an 80x24 resolution. It is fully backwards compatible with the Model III and emulates it perfectly. The Model 4 came with either 64KB or 128KB of RAM, and ran on TRSDOS 6.0, LDOS, or even CP/M. An upgrade kit for Model IIIs was released.The TRS-80 was a moderately cloned computer seeing clones manufactured in South Africa, Hong Kong, North America, Brazil and Europe. A couple Model I clones, the Lobo Max-80 and LNW-80, even cloned the expansion interface. Some clones included all of the features of the Model III, while others improved the graphics of the Model I (Reducing TRS-80 compatibility). Tandy documented their computers and peripherals in very detailed diagrams in the system's manual, which may have been a factor in the amount of clones on the market. Unlike the ZX Spectrum, Tandy clones are no longer being manufactured anywhere in the world.The TRS-80 had a wide variety of games ranging across all genres. There were arcade ports, ports from other home computer games, and plenty of original titles as well. TRS-80 games are unique in their creative use of the semigraphics and low resolutions. Due to the various TRS-80 models, games were largely incompatible between systems, and as such there was no standard TRS-80 game that could be played on every TRS-80. Tandy garnered early support from big developers like Adventure International, SSI, and Avalon Hill.Apple PanicArkanoidBall Turret GunnerDemon SeedFroggerMissile AttackRear GuardRogueStarcrossThe WitnessZaxxonZork",

The console was released by Bandai, with one of the lead designers being Gunpei Yokoi (famed creator of the Game Boy and producer of the Metroid franchise who was killed before the release of the system). The WonderSwan was created to try and compete with other industry leaders; the Neo Geo Pocket and the Game Boy. The WonderSwan Color was eventually released, but many WonderSwan Color games are also compatible with the original WonderSwan. The WonderSwan was originally available in ten different colors.The WonderSwan was designed to be played either vertically or horizontally. Games varied on this aspect, with a wide variety of games. The games for the system were primarily Japanese, as the console was designed for this market, but some still feature English as a language. Many popular RPGs were ported to the system, such as Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy IV, and Front Mission.

    "description": "A first generation 5200 with 4 portsIn 1982, Atari introduced the Atari 5200 Supersystem to the gaming public. Still enjoying the massive success from their last home console, the Atari 2600, Atari decided to produce a game system based on its popular line of 8-bit computers, which were also quickly becoming a popular gaming platform. Games could be ported very easily from the Atari 400/800 line of computers to the Atari 5200. In the eyes of Atari management, this would encourage third-party development for the 5200 system as their 8-bit computers already had a dedicated group of developers. However the design for various parts of the 5200 would not only differentiate the console from Atari's own product line (Atari 2600, Atari400/800) but would also differentiate itself from its home console competition ( Intellivision/ ColecoVision).The largest difference between the 5200 from Atari's 8-bit computers and 2600 is the unique analog joystick. The controller allows for full 360-degree movement. Additionally, it has a second firing button and a keypad. The joystick does not self-center and is therefore prone to getting stuck, making it more difficult to play particular games such as Asteroids.The infamous 5200 controllerThe 5200's keypad holds overlays, similar to the Intellivision's controller. Many Atari 5200 games came packed with overlays, as did third party games from Activision and CBS, while Parker Brothers packed only Frogger with an overlay. Brands other than CBS include an overlay holder on the cartridge back. Another innovative feature of the 5200 controllers was the inclusion of a pause button, making it one of the first consoles to allow users to pause the action at any point.The controllers were prone to failure. This led to several third-party vendors (most notably Wico) to release third-party controllers of varying quality and devices that would allow the use of the 9-pin 2600 joysticks on the 5200.Later, Atari would release a trackball-based controller, akin to the Marble Madness arcade controller. Reception for this controller (officially called the Trak-Ball Controller), like the console itself, was lukewarm. The controller was as big as the console and was inconsistent in tracking movement. Atari later released a redesigned trackball controller with better motion detection and a more compact design, but by that time the 5200 had already failed to captivate audiences.The original 5200 also came with a unique RF switch box that supplied power to the 5200 on the same cable that fed audio and video to the television. It reduced the number of cables running across users' floors, but was more expensive to manufacture and replace. The 5200 was incompatible with alternative adapters, making replacements harder to find. Atari later released a redesigned second generation 5200 system that was compatible with any normal power supply and RF switch box. The second generation 5200 had two joystick ports, unlike the original that had four (like the Atari 800 computer).Far fewer games were released for the 5200 than that of competing consoles from Intellivision and ColecoVision. Few third-party game developers adopted the console because the 2600 already had 20 million users while the 5200 struggled to maintain 1 million users. Also development for the 2600 was cheaper and didn't require newer technology. The few games that were released for the 5200 were mostly designed or produced in-house by Atari. The console's short life span, due in part to the infamous game crash of 1984, curbed further growth of the console's game library.The Atari 5200 was not well received by consumers when it was released and was never able to completely recover from its lukewarm reception. Various design and technical flaws, which ranged from an unreliable controller to an unusual RF adapter, discouraged users from adopting the console. The first wave of 5200s were also incompatible with 2600 games, requiring users to buy a separate adapter to play their back catalog of 2600 games. Atari officially announced the system was discontinued in 1984 upon the announcement of the 7800 (which would not be released until two years later)Beyond the hardware, poor business decisions helped further seal the 5200's fate. First, Atari failed to motivate third-party development for the console. Second, Atari management decided to devote most of their resources to the already oversaturated 2600 market while leaving the 5200 idle. Atari had numerous replacement consoles for the 5200 in the works before they decided to invest research and development into the Atari 7800. Atari Inc. originally planned on developing a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. This prototype was called the Atari 5100 and would have been a more simple and user friendly 5200, but the project was eventually canceled. Before settling on the 7800 Atari's originally planned sequel to the 5200 was a system called the 3200, but its development halted because it was too difficult to develop for.CPU: Custom MOS 6502C @ 1.79 MHzRAM: 16 KBROM: 2KB on-board BIOS; 32 KB window for standard game cartridges.Graphics: ANTIC and GTIA chips similar to those in Atari's 400/800 home computersSound: 4-channel POKEY chipScreen Resolution: 320x192 resolutionSize: 13\" x 15\" x 4.35\"",

    "description": "Atari 7800 Pro SystemThe Atari 7800 was announced on May 21st, 1984, and was planned to cost consumers $140. In the eyes of Atari management the Atari 7800 would be a return to form after the lackluster performance of the Atari 5200, as the Atari 7800 would address almost all of the shortcomings of the Atari 5200. However due to series of unfortunate events and ill-conceived business decisions the system wouldn’t launch until almost two years after its announcement. By this time Nintendo and Sega were dominating a newly rejuvenated home console market in the United States, but Atari still saw the opportunity to re-introduce the Atari name into American homes. Yet the Atari 7800 would mark a turning point for Atari as a console manufacturer as the console’s struggle to regain public popularity marked the eventual collapse of the Atari brand name and company as a whole.In July of 1984, the home video game division of Atari was purchased by the now infamous Jack Tramiel. Although the Atari 7800 was ready to go at this point, licensing negotiations had to begin again because the Tramiels did not agree with existing licensing arrangements, as a result the release of the 7800 was delayed. It was around this time that the video game market crashed, and retailers cut orders and shipments for video games across the board. As a result, by the end of 1984 the industry was left with only Atari, Coleco ( ColecoVision), and Mattel ( Intellivision) all of which decided to turn out new product for their old systems instead of developing new consoles, as such no new consoles were on the horizon for the United States. However Atari after spending the last two years working out the paperwork for the 7800s, by 1986 the 7800 was ready for release.One of the few third party games for the 7800However, on October 15, 1985, everything changed.Unbeknownst to Atari, a Japanese company called Nintendo decided to bring their successful Famicom console over to the United States. In their ignorance Atari management ignored the Famicom, and even skipped the chance to publish the American version of the Famicom. This mistake alone would prove to be one of the most costly mistakes ever enacted by Atari and even the video game industry.Despite the fact that the American home console market was reeling from the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo still saw potential consumers. They were right; by 1986 the Nintendo Entertainment System had become an enormous hit with American consumers. With this in mind Tramiel and Atari continued with the release of the 7800, in hopes of reaping in the rewards of a newly awaken home console market.At launch the 7800 had twelve titles ready to play. Also the system was completely compatible with 2600 games, a feature that the previous 5200 console lacked. The public was excited, and the 7800 was poised to take over the gaming world, but unfortunately it didn't quite happen that way.Not exactly what we would call a \"killer-app\"Instead Tamriel and the rest of Atari management would make various business mistakes with the release of the system. The first of which was the fact that Atari had failed to promote and captivate developers to adopt the system and develop games for the 7800. Instead Atari would concentrate on advertising the complete backwards compatibility the 7800 had with the 2600 games instead of the 7800's own library of games. In fact only 10 games were developed and released by third party developers for the 7800 during its lifetime, 6 from Absolute Entertainment; 2 from Activision; and 2 from Froggo. This meant that the 7800 would have to rely on in-house development from Atari in order to supply games for the system. However was not enough to compete with the NES’s or even the Sega Master System’s rapidly expanding video game libraries. Also the launch for the system itself was poorly planned. Of the promised tweleves launch titles only three were actually available at the time of the system's launch. Not only that but the 7800 was poorly distributed amongst retailers making the system hard to find during its launch. As a result the 7800 was never able to recover from its rocky launch and in the end due to poorly conceived business decisions and a highly competitive console market failed to reach the market capitalization that Atari had hoped the system would obtain.1986: 286,4171987: 1,599,978 (+1,313,561)1988: 3,023,955 (+1,423,977)1989: 3,679,308 (+655,353)1990: 3,772,751 (+93,443)Atari Pro-Line ControllerAt the time of its release, the 7800 was initially billed as a graphical powerhouse. The new custom CPU and MARIA graphics chip that would power the system were capable of moving up to 100 objects on-screen (drawn with a line-buffer) at the same time and capable of displaying up to 25 colors on screen out of a 256 color palette. However, the system suffered from poor audio quality due to the fact that the system utilized the same sound chip from the 2600.The system is indeed compatible with almost 100% of the existing Atari 2600 game library, and all the existing 2600 controllers and peripherals are compatible as well. The 7800 was also sold with its own special Proline controllers which were meant to be an improvement over the 5200 design. The controller was a two-button controller, allowing for greater functionality than the classic one-button from the 2600 days.Along with inferior sound quality, the 7800 was also technically lacking compared to the NES in several other ways. The 7800's CPU and MARIA graphics chip both shared the same RAM memory address space, interrupting each other's cycles when attempting to access RAM and slowing down the system, whereas the NES had separate RAM memory address spaces for its CPU and PPU graphics chip, allowing both to run at full speeds. The 7800's coarse scrolling, with occasional 8-pixel jumps, was not as smooth as the NES's continuous pixel-by-pixel scrolling. The 7800 also lacked a tilemap engine like the NES, meaning the 7800 had to use more memory and processing to produce the same amount of graphics as the NES, and also had to draw tiled backgrounds using numerous sprites, slowing down the system and making it difficult for third-party developers to produce tiled side-scrolling games for the system. While the 7800 had a 320x200 resolution mode, it was resource-intensive, so most 7800 games usually ran at the lower-resolution 160x200 mode (compared to the NES's 256x224 resolution).Sales from the console were middling outside of the United Sates. With numerous third party developers quickly dropping support for the 7800 and gamers everywhere ignoring the console as a whole Atari pulled the plug on the 7800 by 1992 and ceased all production of the console. In the end Atari was no longer the console manufacturer that it once was, but unconvinced by their failure Atari would make one last ditch effort to regain their once dominant status in the video game console market.* CPU: Custom 6502CSpeed: 1.79 MHz, drops to 1.19 MHz when the TIA or RIOT chips are accessed(note: This is Atari's custom 6502 known as SALLY which can be halted to allow other devices to control the bus)* RAM: 4 KB (2 6116 2Kx8 RAM ICs)* ROM: built in 4 KB BIOS ROM, 48 KB Cartridge ROM space without bankswitching* Graphics: MARIA custom graphics controller (halts CPU when in use)160x200 (160x240 PAL) resolution or 320x200 (320x240) resolution25 color palette out of 256 colors (16 hues * 16 luma), different graphics modes restricted the number of usable colors and the number of colors per spriteDirect Memory Access (DMA)Graphics clock: 7.16 MHz (halted when CPU in use)* I/O: Joystick and console switch IO handled byte 6532 RIOT and TIA* Ports: 2 joystick ports, 1 cartridge port, 1 expansion connector, power in, RF output* Sound: TIA video and sound chip, same as the 2600.

It sported a few features that were years ahead of their time, including a touch screen, two cartridge ports (although later models did eventually move back to a single port), and internet connectivity through an optional 14.4 kb/s modem.Duke Nukem 3DIndy 500Lights OutMortal Kombat TrilogyTiger CasinoSince the company's inception Tiger had produced Game & Watch style handheld games based on popular film, television, and videogame licenses. They released a cartridge based handheld system called the R-Zone in 1995, but it died out quickly as the Game Boy had begun to all but monopolize the handheld market and the simpler titles Tiger had producing were unappealing to gamers. In an attempt to dethrone the Game Boy, Tiger released the Game.com in 1997 with a puzzle title, Lights Out, as the pack-in game. With the licenses obtained for use in their Game & Watch style titles still in effect the system had what could be considered a lineup full of killer apps, albeit all developed in house at Tiger. Popular console titles such as Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Williams Arcade Classics, Sonic Jam, and Fighters Megamix were released either at launch or shortly after alongside adaptations of popular Tiger handheld products including Henry and Quiz Wiz, plus a promotional booklet teased ports of Road Rash, EA Sports titles and games based on upcoming films such as Batman & Robin and The Lost World: Jurrasic Park. (few of which were actually released)Tiger also had something else up its sleeve for the Game.com - it was to be the first handheld system to feature internet connectivity. This was, in fact, the handheld's main selling point. Internet connectivity was not without its flaws, however; as the system was released a good while before \"Wi-Fi\" was a popular buzzword. Internet access required a phone cord and jack, as well as a bulky external modem, to work, plus users were required to use Tiger's own ISP to get online. Internet connectivity was also not up to par even with what you'd find on most cell phones today; while the Game.com was equipped with a web browser it only allowed users to access text-only versions of the webpage they wished to view, and interaction with the games themselves was relegated only to online scoreboards. Users could also check their email through the service, but due to the high cost of getting the Game.com online, adoption rates for the console's online services were low.Later in the console's lifespan Tiger released a new, smaller version called the Game.com Pocket Pro. It featured a smaller screen, one cartridge port, a lit screen (in the first few production runs), and eliminated the console's internet functions. New games, including ports of Resident Evil 2 and the modernized versions of Centipede and Frogger, were released alongside the console. In 2000, when both the original Game.com and the Pocket Pro failed in the marketplace Tiger pulled support of the system, leaving games such as Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Giga Pets, and Foreman Boxing (supposedly with force feedback capabilities) unfinished.While the console was a commercial failure, internet capabilities in handheld gaming devices became a popular feature in later handheld consoles. The console also featured a touch screen before the Nintendo DS made touch-screen gaming popular in the handheld market. The console's failure caused Tiger to leave the gaming market, however, and focus on developing consumer electronics aimed at children.In 2005, an online group referring to themselves as the \"game.commies\" announced they would be working on hacking the game.com platform to enable emulation. After several years, It was finally released to the internet and is now publicly available as of October, 2011.",

    "description": "Arcade is simply defined as a place where people can hang out and have fun. However, over time, the word is mostly recognized today as a place to play video games and have fun. This was mainly because designer cabinets with screens inside them would provide games that people can enjoy. They would become known as Video Game Arcade machines.Throughout the late 20th century, arcade machines were known for having the most cutting-edge technology in gaming, with superior graphics and audio capabilities than both home consoles and personal computers, as well as controls and peripherals not possible (or very expensive) on home machines. By the early 21st century, however, arcades had been surpassed by the PC platform in terms of graphics, and by home consoles in terms of popularity. Despite its decline, arcades still have the largest video game library of any platform, with more than 25,000 video game releases according to the MAMEdb online database.While electro-mechanical arcade games, particularly light-gun shooters such as Sega's Duck Hunt, had existed before, the arcade video game industry began in 1971, with Computer Space in August and Galaxy Game in September (for $20,000 at the time, equivalent to over $100,000 today); both games, based on Spacewar, were unsuccessful. The first successful video game was Atari's Pong, which originally retailed for $700 in 1972 (equivalent to about $4000 in 2012 dollars).Pac-Man would become a huge hit for Arcade Games.Video game arcade machines would later start to gain mainstream popularity from the late 1970s and peak during the early 1980s. This period is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games and began in 1978 with the release of Space Invaders, which became the first blockbuster video game. It put an end to the 1977 video game market crash, caused a national coin shortage in Japan, became a huge success worldwide, and laid the foundations for most shooters and action games released since then.The next blockbuster video game was Pac-Man in 1980. It would become a huge success, causing the developers to create a sequel Ms. Pac-Man. Both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man would become so huge that people of all ages and genders filled the arcades playing the game, from children who played after school or the weekends, to adults who played during their lunch breaks, and after work.Pac-Man and Space Invaders each grossed billions of dollars worldwide and remain the highest-grossing video games of all time. These games, along with some others, such as Galaxian, Asteroids, Galaga, Defender, Frogger, Missile Command, and Donkey Kong, kept the arcade scene booming in the early 1980s.Arcade games had become a multi-billion dollar industry. In North America, arcade video games even grossed higher revenues than both Hollywood and pop music combined, a rare feat that the North American video game industry has never been able to replicate again ever since.Some of the technological advances that occurred during the this era include RGB colour graphics (from Speed Race Twin to Space Invaders Deluxe and Galaxian), vertical scrolling (Speed Race and Xevious) and side-scrolling (from Bomber to Scramble), isometric projection (Zaxxon), first-person perspective (from Balloon Gun and Wild Gunman to Duck Hunt), third-person perspective (from Fonz to Pole Position and Buck Rogers), vector graphics (from Asteroids to Space Fury), 3D polygon graphics (I, Robot), stereoscopic 3D effect (SubRoc-3D), chiptune soundtrack (from Gun Fight and Space Invaders to Rally-X and Super Locomotive), and stereo sound (Turbo).From 1983 onwards, the arcade market began experiencing a decline (though not as severe as the console market crash). By the mid-1980s, the popularity of arcade games declined further with the release of Nintendo's sequel to arcade game Mario Bros, called Super Mario Bros, which became a phenomenon and would put home consoles on the map. The NES's rising popularity slowly began to rival the arcade's dominance over the gaming industry. After Super Mario Bros made a killing on Nintendo's own console, a special arcade version named VS: Super Mario Bros appeared in the arcades. This version had levels that were different and more challenging than the console version. Since then, video game developers released innovative and fun video games in arcades that would create a lasting effect for over a decade in the United States.In 1985, Yu Suzuki and his Sega AM2 team revitalized the arcade industry with Hang-On, which introduced features that could not be replicated on home systems: advanced graphics (pseudo-3D, \"Super Scaler\" sprite-scaling), and more importantly, a motion-controlled hydraulic motorbike cabinet, introducing full-body motion control. Suzuki's intention behind the motion controls was to make arcade games more accessible to casual users, and he continued this with hits like Space Harrier and OutRun. This new emphasis on a motion-controlled experience revitalized the arcade game industry in the late 1980's, and would be what kept it alive decades later with dancing games like Konami's Bemani franchise (up until motion controls came to consoles with Nintendo's Wii and then Microsoft's Xbox Kinect).In 1987 came another game that played a key role in the resurgence of arcades: Double Dragon, which started the golden age of side-scrolling beat 'em up games, a genre that would peak in popularity with Final Fight two years later. Meanwhile, Sega continued pushing the boundaries of sprite-scaling 2.5D graphics with \"Super Scaler\" arcade games like After Burner and Galaxy Force. At the same time, Taito and Namco released the first gaming hardware specifically designed for 3D graphics in 1988: the Taito Air System (running Top Landing) and Namco System 21 \"Polygonizer\" (running Winning Run). However, the arcades began experiencing yet another relative decline by the end of the decade.NBA JAM. Just one of many big Arcade hits in the 1990s.In 1991, the arcade gaming industry experienced a Renaissance with the release of Street Fighter II. It popularized competitive hand-to-hand fighting games and revived the arcade industry to a level of popularity not seen since the days of Pac-Man. The arcades once again dominated the gaming industry, with arcade games once again surpassing the revenues of Hollywood (which led to many video game movies). Many of the best-selling home video games in the early 1990's were also often arcade ports. During this era, developers like Sega, Namco, Midway, Capcom and Konami became household names because of their great arcade games.3D polygon graphics became increasingly popular during this era due to developers pushing the boundaries of early 3D graphics technology in the arcades, most notably Sega and Namco, with games like Virtua Racing (which popularized 3D polygon graphics), Ridge Racer (which introduced texture-mapped 3D polygons), Daytona USA (which introduced 3D texture filtering), Rave Racer (which introduced hi-res texture mapping), and the Virtua Fighter series (the first game introduced relatively detailed 3D human characters, with the second and third games further pushing the boundaries of 3D graphical realism).In the 1990's, arcade video games became so big that you had developers making hit games based off of movies, cartoons, comics, and television shows. Sports games using authentic sports licenses were also made and became quite popular. This, along with inflation, would result in prices for play going up. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, most arcade games cost a quarter per play. However, this soon changed to fifty cents, seventy-five cents, and some games were even a full dollar for first play. At the time people didn't mind because the arcade was also known as the place to see and enjoy the latest graphics, audio and controls in video gaming. Even though the console market made a solid foundation in the homes of millions of Americans, most of them knew that the graphics, audio and controls in their chosen console didn't match the superior ones found in the arcade cabinets. Despite ports of popular arcade games hitting consoles, gamers knew they were getting a watered down version of the original.Street Fighter Alpha. Example of a 2D arcade game perfectly ported to 32-bit consoles.The success of arcade games began to change for the worse in the late 1990's when 3D and CD-based console gaming start becoming popular. This began with the arrival of the 32-bit consoles, the Saturn and PlayStation. Because of their ability to produce 3D graphics, improved capability in 2D graphics, and the compact disc ability to carry a lot of data, developers were finally able to make good ports of their games to sell on consoles. Business is business, and the developers saw where they could make a lot more money porting near-flawless copies of their games to popular gaming consoles. Because of this, gamers no longer felt they needed to spend money in the arcades to play the latest eye candy, as they could simply go to the store or mall and buy a decent port of the full game for their console.However, while 32-bit consoles could produce 2D graphics on par with arcades, the arcades still remained competitive in the mid-to-late 1990s by pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics considerably beyond what consoles or PC's were capable of, particularly when it came to powerful arcade machines like Sega's Model 2 (released 1993) and Model 3 (released 1996) or Namco's System 22 (released 1993) and System 23 (released 1997). However, this changed in 1998, when Sega's Dreamcast became the first home system to produce 3D graphics almost on-par with arcade machines at the time, due to being based on the Sega Naomi arcade hardware (though with half the RAM). By the 21st century, console gaming had surpassed arcade gaming in terms of popularity, while PC gaming eventually surpassed arcade gaming in terms of graphical capabilities. As a result, arcades in North America have been on life support in some areas and dead in others.Your average Japanese Arcade place.Arcades are still popular in Japan, however, as the Japanese see arcades as part of their national tradition. Many Japanese children as well as adults all go to huge and loud arcade places, that usually have sit down machines. As a result, many major and minor developers are still able to make games and turn a profit releasing those games in Japan. Many of these arcade games usually get ported over to the United States and release on the consoles. As of today, many video game developers are now making arcade games using modern PC hardware (whereas before, console and PC hardware were often based on arcade machines), making sure the legacy lives on forever.In recent years, the economic recession, along with competition from the Wii (which introduced arcade-like motion controls to homes), has affected the Japanese arcade industry, which has been slowly declining after hitting its peak in the mid-2000's. However, consoles have also begun declining in Japan due to the rise of handhelds and mobile gaming (with Japan having the largest handheld and mobile gaming markets in the world).Arcade machines are currently thriving in other emerging markets in Asia, particularly in South Korea and especially China, where arcades are widespread across the country; in China's case, this may be partly due to a ban on video game consoles by the Chinese government, which did not lift the console ban until 2013.Due to the arcade's continued relevance in Asia, many technologies continued to be released for arcades before appearing on consoles. Many Japanese arcade machines today offer online multiplayer, allowing players to connect to arcade machines (and sometimes home machines) elsewhere in the world, a feature that has been around since at least the 1990's, a popular example being the Sega Naomi arcade system (which allowed arcade and Dreamcast users to interact over SegaNet) in the late 1990s. Later advances that appeared in arcade gaming before they reached home consoles include the use of various musical peripherals in Bemani games like Beatmania (1997), GuitarFreaks (1998), Dance Dance Revolution (1998), and DrumMania (1999); accurate motion controls in games like Police 911 (2000) and Mazan (2002); magnetic cards and touch controls in games like World Club Champion Football (2002) and Sangokushi Taisen (2005); and multi-touch in games like DJ Max Technika (2008).In 2012, Square Enix's Taito division as well as Sega released their next-generation arcade machines, Taito Type X3 and Sega RingEdge 2, which are comparable in power to the 2013 consoles PS4 and Xbox One. The first games for the Type X3 and RingEdge 2 were Gunslinger Stratos and Guilty Gear XX Λ Core Plus R, respectively, in 2012.Ms. Pacman a Upright Arcade Cabinet Controlled with a joystick.Arcade cabinets come in many shapes and sizes to best fit the game that they are housing. The most common a style of arcade cabinet in North America is the standard upright cabinet. These cabinets tend to be large and heavy due to there inefficient use of space inside the machine and use of heavy materials such a MDF and metal. Upright cabinets are often six feet tall and take up no more than three feet in width. Normally someone would have to stand to operate the cabinet, or sit on a tall bar stool.The control options for upright arcade cabinets vary from game to game, but commonly contain joysticks, buttons, trackballs, and spinners.Also common in North America is the counter-top cabinets. This are cabinets that sit on top of something, like a bar or table to raise them up to playing height. Counter-top cabinets are popular because they save needed floor space and are less intrusive than a full sized cabinet. Although any game or control scheme could be made to work on a counter-top cabinet, they are most popular with touch screen trivia games in bars or pubs.Popular Cocktail Cabinet War Lords.Cocktail Cabinets are low to the ground, table like cabinets. Normally a table will have controls on opposite ends of the table, and in some rare cases on all four sides.The monitor will switch orientation to match the appropriate player, with the expiation of four player games where all four people get there own quarter of screen or share a screen. Table style cabinets have the advantage of being a multi-purpose piece of furniture. The monitor is normally cover with plexiglass to prevent damage to the screen from spilt drinks or food.Candy Cabs are Japanese sitdown cabinets. They are called candy cabs because the exterior finish resembles hard candy. See MVS section in the Neo Geo page for more information.PlayChoice-10 was an arcade machine released by Nintendo to capitalize on the popularity of arcades in the 1990's, See PlayChoice-10 for more information.And finally, there are many \"deluxe\" arcade cabinets, which are sit-down cabinets with various different shapes and designs, ranging from Hang-On's motion-controlled motorbike and Space Harrier's rotating cockpit to G-Loc's 360-degree rotating cockpit and Ridge Racer's hydraulic-powered replica car.

    "description": "NUON was a failed attempt by Toshiba, Motorola, Samsung, and Raite Optoelectronics to add gaming, internet, and enhanced navigation to certain DVD players. NUON technology was developed by VM Labs Inc. as an attempt to turn passive digital video into an interactive experience. NUON DVD players were supposed to be the \"all-in-one\" digital media experience. Richard Miller, using experience gained developing Atari Jaguar hardware, created a powerful 128-bit processor to embed in DVD players. The NUON had the power to decode audio and video while providing and enhanced UI and trick-play modes. More importantly, it provided a platform for 3D digital interactive content straight from a DVD player. NUON technology was only added to a handful of DVD players and support for the platform was abysmal. VM Labs filed for bankruptcy in 2001, just one year after the release of the NUON. VM Labs sold the NUON technology to Genesis Microchip, where development ceased after July 2002.At the core of the NUON is the Aries 3 chip, which was based on a 128-bit, 4 way parallel VLIW processor architecture. It manages the CPU, decodes audio and video, and preforms all system management. A hardware block on the chip assisted with MPEG video decoding so the Aries 3 was free to process other instructions. The chip was very powerful for it's time.Features of the Aries 3:MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 audio/video decoding5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio decodingExtended DVD trick modes32-voice wave table synthesizerMP3 audio decodingContent Scrambling System descrambling moduleVideo Scaling3D video gamingThe first DVD player to use NUON technology was the Toshiba SD-2300. The technology in the few available NUON DVD players raised the price around $100 over comparable players. The choice to market games to the movie audience ultimately ended up being a mistake. Sales were very poor, and support was absolutely terrible. The first NUON enhanced DVD was the software/movie Bedazzled by Fox Home Video. Just about every other publisher waited on the technology and support never truly came to the device. With the PlayStation 2's release imminent as a game console that plays DVDs rather than a DVD player that plays games, the chances of success for the NUON had gone. The public opted for the game console that was cheaper and had much better support for games.The NUON had a variety of controllers, one popular standard one being white in color with a D-pad with 4 buttons. The stealth gamepad is 3-pronged controller with a mini analog stick, a D-pad, and a trigger button. It is designed very similarly to the Nintendo 64's controller. A memory unit was planned for Q1 2002 release for the NUON in sizes ranging from 2MB to 4MB, but was canceled. Many games used passwords to make up for the lack of a released memory card.Only eight games were ever released for NUON. The graphics are comparable to early PlayStation 2 games, and are most notable in Iron Soldier 3, a mech combat game. The best game is generally regarded to be Tempest 3000 (many sources consider it the only truly playable game) and it's valued at much more than the other NUON games. Games were controlled via a proprietary controller. Depending on the model, there could be one or two controller ports.The NUON homebrew community was more active than the commercial community. In late 2001, VM Labs released a homebrew SDK so developers could put out their own homebrew NUON software, even as the platform died and faded into obscurity.

There is also a Game Room application that lets you download and play old games through the application that must be downloaded through the marketplace.Xbox Live Arcade is where game publishers release download-only games. It started with mostly rereleases of classic arcade titles like Gauntlet, Smash TV, and Frogger, but later expanded to expanded to new, original titles like Shadow Complex, Castle Crashers, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.Games on Demand allows users to purchase retail Xbox 360 games as well as original Xbox games that have been made backwards compatible. Certain games have been released simultaneously at retail and on Games on Demand (i.e.Crackdown 2), however there is usually a delay between the retail release and the digital release.Xbox Live Indie Games are games made by independent developers and are self-published onto the marketplace. The price of these games are generally cheaper, but they are not rated by the ESRB nor does Microsoft ensure the quality of the game.Some games have been de-listed from the marketplace, here's a list of them all.

The PlayStation Store provides different kinds of content, such as games, demos, trailers, themes, wallpapers, add-ons, music, television shows, and movies, either for free or for a fixed price. The PlayStation Store is updated every Tuesday with new content, and on special occasions like E3 it is updated off-schedule.In January 2013, Sony launched the Sony Entertainment Network web store in the United States, allowing users to purchase games, movies, and television shows using their computers. Purchased content is simply added to the download list on the user's PlayStation 3 and/or PlayStation Vita. Sony has said that it will add automatic download functionality in the future.Media Go's Game StoreThe Media Go management program has a storefront within it, but as the software is meant for PSPs and Sony-Ericsson phones, it cannot access PS3-only content. All PSP products can be accessed, purchased, downloaded, and transferred. Anything from the video store can either be pushed to PSP or viewed/kept on the PC. Digital Comics from a multitude of publishers are also available, but unlike videos, they cannot be viewed on a computer and must be transferred to the PSP.Your PSN account.Unlike some other online platforms that use points as a means of currency, the PlayStation Store uses the same currency of the country in which the user resides. There are different kinds of payment methods accepted on the PlayStation Store. When you add funds onto your account, those funds are stored in your \"Wallet\". Different methods of adding funds include:Credit CardPre-Paid CardPLAYSTATION Network CardIt should be noted that as of Winter 2008 major retailers such as Walmart, Target, and GameStop carry the PlayStation Network Cards. The cards come in denominations of twenty and fifty dollars.The PlayStation Store was integrated with the PSP in October of 2008. As a part of the PSP update 5.00, PSP users are able to access the store right from their handhelds to download games and media right to their memory stick. This store is the same as the one available for PC. It is important for Sony's strategy to continue to push digital distribution with the PSN so that PSP games will be available day and date to download off the store. The PSP Go is dependent on this due to its lack of a UMD drive.On June 26, 2008, Sony announced Life with PlayStation. It is a free service that features a 3D globe where users can zoom in on certain sections to find the weather and news headlines of that area.

It was not until 6 days later on April 26, 2011 that Patrick Seybold, Senior Director of Corporate Communications and Social Media for SCEA, announced via the PlayStation Blog that personal information for the entire user base, totalling near 77 million users at the time, had been obtained by an unknown third party.

    "description": "Disk-kun, the add-on's mascot characterThe Famicom Disk System was part of a line of add-on systems produced exclusively in Japan for its version of the Nintendo Entertainment System called the Famicom. Its claim to fame was that its games were released on a medium similar to floppy disks. The disks, having two sides, originally contained more space than what a Famicom cartridge was capable of holding. They were also much cheaper to produce, a characteristic meant to lure developers to the platform. The Famicom also features a microphone in the controller, which certain games used, such as an updated version of the original Zelda. Despite the Disk System's moderate success, the majority of the Famicom's library still remained in cartridge form exclusively. Nevertheless, several of Nintendo's series were started on the Famicom Disk System and later entries in the series were available on more mainstream Nintendo platforms.A yellow famicom disk system gameThe Famicom Disk System's games contained internal features impossible to replicate on cartridges. The most notable of these features was their rewriting capability. Aside from being applied to conventional tasks, such as saving progress, certain disks could also have their games entirely overwritten for a small fee.The disks themselves were either a yellow or blue color and have the word Nintendo etched in at the bottom, with the blue version containing a shutter, whereas the yellow does not. Most disks have stickers on both sides that contain the title of the game as well as a large \"A\" or \"B\" (alternatively \"Side A\" or \"Side B\") on the left side of the sticker which tells the player the side of the disk. Typically the player needs to put Side A in first to boot up the game and once they start a game or load a saved file a message will appear on the screen telling the player to switch sides. At this point the player needs to eject the disk and flip it over to side B to start the game. Some disks are one sided meaning side B is blank and doesn't have a sticker on it. Games that have a blank side B do not need to be flipped over at any point.Twin FamicomSharp Corporation released the Twin Famicom in Japan on July 1, 1986, less than five months after the release of the Famicom Disk System. The Twin Famicom combines the Famicom and Famicom Disk System into one system and is officially licensed by Nintendo. The system has a switch just below the cartridge slot that allows the player to switch between using the Disk System or the Famicom. When switched to the Disk System the cartridge slot locks to prevent players from attempting to use both slots at the same time. Similarly, if switched to the Famicom the Disk System slot locks for the same reason.The original release of the system came in two different colors red with black highlights or black with red highlights. There was also a re-release that came in a slightly different case design, turbo controllers, and two new sets of color schemes. The first color scheme is black with green highlights and the second is red with blue and gray highlights.Because Nintendo opted to not distribute the Famicom Disk System outside of Japan, all of its games which received international releases required technical modifications so that they could function on regular cartridges. Ultimately few of these games retained their ability to save games due to the costs of incorporating batteries into the cartridges. ( The Legend of Zelda is one exception, as it still employed battery-backed saving.) Instead, many games, such as Metroid, employed passwords to record players' progress.The original protagonists of Doki Doki PanicThe American version of Super Mario Bros. 2, however, is the most famous of these conversions. Because the original sequel in Japan was deemed to be too difficult for most players at the time, Nintendo chose to bring over what was originally a completely different game instead and retrofit it as a Mario game. The game which was chosen to do this was Doki Doki Panic, an Arabian-themed platformer which had been produced for a television station's special event. The protagonists in the game, a family, were replaced with Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad. Additional technical alterations were made in specific areas of the game, mostly pertaining to specific sprites' animations. Enemies which were part of Doki Doki Panic remained in the new version, with many of them, such as Birdo and Bob-omb, appearing in subsequent Mario games afterwards. This rendition was later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The original Metroid for the Famicom Disk SystemThe Legend of ZeldaMetroidCastlevaniaFamicom Detective Club",

    "description": "In terms of home video games, the PC is the oldest gaming platform still in use today, having an established library of tens of thousands of games. Chances are, you're probably reading this wiki on a PC right now. While there were various different personal computer platforms in the past (from manufacturers like NEC, Apple, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Commodore, Sharp, and Microsoft), the modern PC is largely descended from the IBM PC, which originally released in 1981 for $1561 (nearly $4000 in 2013 dollars).An old IBM PC.The first electronic computers were created between the 1930s and the 1940s. The first binary computer was the Z1 Computer, created by the German inventor Konrad Zuse. Other electronic computers would be created throughout the time period, including the ENIAC and the Harvard Mark I. Many of the first computers were used during World War II by both factions and would be later used for scientific research. Early computers were large enough to fill a room, making them unusable for practical, personal use. Later it would be used by banks and large businesses for economic calculations. Companies like IBM have supplied many businesses with computers years before the personal computer .It wasn't until the 1970s where computers usable for the average person were being made. Invented in 1970 by John V. Blakenbaker of the Kenbak Corporation, the Kenbak-1 is considered by the Computer History Museum to be the world's \"first personal computer\". Starting in 1971, it was sold for $750 and only 40 machines were ever built and sold. In 1973, Kenbak folded and stopped production. However, it was based on TTL (transistor-transistor-logic) discrete circuitry (much like the Magnavox Odyssey and Pong) rather than microprocessor technology. As such, it wasn't until the late 1970s that the first \"true\" personal computers began appearing.Several revolutionary inventions would later pave the way to the modern personal computer, most importantly the microprocessor. The project originated in 1969, when Japanese calculator manufacturer Busicom proposed the idea to American manufacturer Intel, and both soon collaborated to produce the first microprocessor. By 1971, Intel's engineers Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, and Busicom's engineer Masatoshi Shima, succeeded in creating the world's first microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004. The microprocessor helped in creating a more powerful central processing unit than the ones used in computers at the time and shrunk it so computers could be smaller. The microprocessor was the major invention that gave birth to the microcomputer, or the personal computer as it is known today.The first microprocessor-based personal computer, i.e. the first microcomputer, was the SMP80/X, released by Sord (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) in 1974, utilizing the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor (its unreleased 1972 predecessor, the SMP80/08, used the first general-purpose microprocessor, the 8-bit Intel 8008). It was soon followed in 1975 by the Altair 8800, which also used the Intel 8080 as its CPU; since the computer's main language was binary code and only had an output of flashing lights, the computer was unusable by the common person. A similar microcomputer was released by NEC in 1976, the TK-80, which used the Intel 8080A.It wasn't until 1977 when two California college students, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, created the first personal computer with a monitor, the Apple I. Thanks to the monitor, programming became much easier and programmers could see exactly what they were doing. Also, it helped the average user see the programs people created. This sparked a new revolution in the computer industry, bringing the creation of Apple Computers and starting the personal computer market. Other competing desktop computers with CRT display monitors soon followed in the late 1970s, including the M200 by Sord (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) in 1977, Hitachi's Basic Master in 1978, and Acorn's System 1 in 1979.Powerful laptops have made PC gaming mobile.After the release of the Apple II, many competitors formed in the early 1980s, including the IBM Personal Computer, which would later dominate the market in the 1990s. The IBM PC was also one of the first 16-bit home computers, along with Mitsubishi's MULTI16 in 1981. Other leading competitors in the 1980s included Commodore, Atari and Amiga in Western markets, and NEC, Sharp and Fujitsu in Eastern markets. Due to the gaming crash of 1983, many computer manufacturers focused on the business aspects of these machines, leaving gaming as an afterthought.However, there were many computers that were well-known for their gaming libraries. The leading 8-bit gaming computer platforms in the 1980s included the Apple II in North America, the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in the West, the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro in the UK, the MSX in Japan and Europe, the high-resolution NEC PC-88 in Japan, and the high-colour FM-7 and Sharp X1 in Japan. The leading 16/32-bit gaming computers in the late 1980s to early 1990s were the NEC PC-98 in Japan, the Amiga and Atari ST in the West, the MS-DOS Compatible computers worldwide, and the more powerful (near arcade quality) Sharp X68000 and FM Towns computers in Japan. The best-selling computer models of the 20th century were the Commodore 64 (17 million units sold worldwide) and NEC PC-98 (over 18 million units sold in Japan). By the 1990s, companies like Origin Systems and EA became leading PC game developers.In the mid-1980s, the graphical user interface was implemented on new PCs. Now it was easier for people to see what they were doing with computers thanks to computers like the Macintosh and the DOS extension Windows. The GUI was first created by Xerox in the 1960s, but the company was not interested in entering the computer market. Apple was given the rights to use GUI for the Macintosh, however, Microsoft was able to trick Apple into lending them prototype Macintosh computers to create programs for the new machines. They used the coding of the operating system to create Windows, an extension to DOS. Thanks to the cheap $100 price point and its compatibility with all DOS computers, Windows became a success, becoming the new standard of computers by the mid-1990s.The 1980s also saw the emergence of portable laptop computers. The world's first laptop computer was the Epson HX-20 in 1981. The first commercially successful laptop was Kyocera's Kyotronic 85, originally released in 1983 and re-branded by Tandy as the TRS-80 Model 100, selling 6 million units worldwide. Other competitors soon followed, including Sharp's PC-5000 which had a touchpad pointing device in 1983, and Commodore's SX 64 in 1984. The first mass-market laptop was Toshiba's 16-bit T-1100 in 1985, which they followed with the T-3100 (the first with a built-in hard drive) in 1986. Other competitors soon followed, including NEC's PC-98 LT and IBM's PC Convertible in 1986 and Apple's Macintosh Portable in 1989. The first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite, which they followed with the first colour TFT LCD laptop in 1990, the 32-bit PC-9801 NC. Apple soon followed with the PowerBook series from 1991 onwards, further popularizing laptop computers in the 1990s.In the 1990s, the Internet was released to the public after originally being used to connect college computers and military computers to different networks. Since the Internet was introduced to the public, it became a major part of modern society. Now the average computer user is able to access files from many different servers, and have the ability to communicate with people from around the world. This new technology was a revolution in gaming, with online gaming becoming a standard on the PC by the mid 1990s.Another important revolution for PC gaming was the introduction of 3D graphics accelerator cards in the late 1990s, which allowed the PC to take the lead in cutting-edge 3D graphics technology by the 21st century. The first 3D graphics card for a home computer was NEC's PC-FXGA, released for their PC-98 platform in 1995, which could produce 3D graphics surpassing the PlayStation console and rivaling the Nintendo 64 in terms of polygon rendering performance. The first 3D graphics cards for IBM-compatible PC's soon followed in early 1996: Creative Labs' 3D Blaster, NVIDIA's NV1, and particularly NEC's PowerVR. While the 3D Blaster and NV1 (with the first game to support them being PlayStation port Toshinden) were unable to rival the PlayStation, the PowerVR surpassed the PlayStation and even approached arcade quality graphics, with a near arcade quality PowerVR demo of Namco's Rave Racer (though this PC port was later cancelled). Similarly, the NV1 card received PC ports of Sega titles Virtua Fighter Remix and Virtua Cop (which surpassed the Saturn versions, but couldn't rival the arcade originals). In late 1996, 3dfx launched the Voodoo line, which rivalled the PowerVR in quality and would soon become the most popular PC graphics cards of the late 1990s. Fujitsu soon introduced the FXG-1 \"Pinolite\" geometry processor, the first GPU with T&L (Transform & Lighting) hardware capabilities, in 1997, paving the way for NVIDIA's GeForce and ATI's Radeon, both of which would later dominate the PC graphics card market in the 21st century.Today, more than a billion people around the world use the PC platform, with the majority of them being connected to the internet. A majority of PC gamers today are located in Asia, with China alone accounting for nearly a third of the worldwide PC gaming market, the growth of which has largely been fueled by the rise of online gaming.Before operating systems, one had to learn complex coding in order to get something to work. With the creation of operating systems, computers became more accessible to the public.Almost all PC games are designed for MS Windows.Windows was originally an extension to Microsoft's own coding system MS-DOS back in 1985. With Windows, people could easily browse through their files and do other simple functions much more quickly. Windows has grown in popularity and became the most popular OS in the world, having the support of PC makers like Dell, Gateway, and HP. Windows has gone through many iterations, starting with the MS-DOS days having Windows versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11. Then came Windows NT 3.0-4.0 and Windows 2000 (oriented toward business) and the Windows 9x operating systems including Windows 95, 98, and ME (oriented toward home users). The 9x line was dropped and later versions of Windows have been based on NT, continuing the line from 2000 through XP, Vista, Windows 7, and now Windows 8.The preferred platform for modern PC games is a Windows PC running either Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8(.1). Windows XP does not support DirectX 10 but does not suffer from incompatibilities with older games like Vista, 7, or 8 may. Vista and 7 have the advantage of DirectX 10 or 11 while Windows 8.1 can support up to DirectX 11.2, and some exclusive games tied to the OS such as Halo 2. Because of the negative feedback that came from Vista, game developers were reluctant to make DirectX 10 only games. Thanks to the success of Windows 7, more DirectX 10/11 only games are being made, most notably Shattered Horizon, Just Cause 2, and Battlefield 3.Windows 7 provides gamers with a games browser that notifies the user of patches and updates for some games as they become available. Windows 7 is generally faster than Vista and fixes many of the issues people had with that OS such as intrusive Security settings and sluggish performance, Windows 7 also comes with DirectX 11. Dirt2 was among the first games to support this.On October 25, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. This new operating system introduces the \"Metro\" interface, which makes menus more easily accessible to people who are using tablets and touch controls. Windows 8 also introduces its own app store which will allow developers to publish and distribute their Metro applications and games. Xbox Live is integrated with the OS which can be used as a user account for the computer and can earn achievement points on games downloaded from the app store. There have been complaints about the new OS because of its lackluster desktop interface and the removal of the standard Start menu in favor of the Metro interface, but Windows 8.1 addressed some of these issues with the return of the Start menu and the ability to use windowed Metro apps.On July 29, 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 to the public. It's a free update for all Windows 7 and 8 users for the first year of release, making it the first Windows OS that is available for free. One of the major features of Windows 10 is it's cross compatibility with tablets and smartphones as well as desktop and laptop PCs, as well as being implemented for Xbox One consoles in the future. It also features a new voice companion called Cortana, which is meant to compete with Apple's Siri. For gaming, Windows 10 introduces DirectX 12, which allows programmers to get better performance out of older graphics hardware with less oversight. Although current graphics cards can support some of the features of DirectX 12, fully-featured DX12 cards are not expected to release until 2016. The first game to support DX12 will be Fable Legends, which is releasing as a free-to-play title by the end of 2015. It also introduces further connections with the Xbox brand, where Microsoft will be selling games with the Xbox brand on the App Store as well as allow you to stream games from the Xbox One on all Windows 10 devices.Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.In 1977, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs made the Apple 1, Apple's first computer. They later gained popularity with the Apple II. In 1984, Apple released the Macintosh, which was the first Apple computer to have an operating system. The Mac OS lineup was born. Later, Apple switched to Unix-like coding, creating the Mac OS X lineup, which is still used in the new Apple computer lineup today.The main issue with gaming on a Mac OS is that almost all earlier Mac PCs were not compatible with Windows based video games. More recently however with the creation of applications such as Boot Camp and Parallels more games are able to be run. The development of Intel based Macs also helps reduce this barrier by lifting some of the hardware restrictions.In May 2010, Valve released Steam for Mac OS X, and ported all of their Source games to the Mac platform by the end of 2010. Valve is hoping for the expansion of Mac gaming in the near future.During the WDCC in 2014, Apple has announced their own graphics API, Metal. It allows game developers to use more hardware resources from devices using Mac OS X or iOS to gain better performance. This allows devices such as Macbooks and the iPad to run games with comparable performance to Windows PCs and consoles. Because of Metal, it was announced that Frostbite 3 is coming to Mac OS X and iOS, with its flagship title being Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.Linux is a Unix-like OS licenced under the GPL. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, which require specific hardware for the OS to work properly, Linux is a software-based OS, which can be installed on a variety of devices, including devices which are not PC-based. Linux comes in various distributions, or \"distros,\" such as Ubuntu or Gentoo. Being an open source OS, the Linux community actively develops open source software, including games, for the Linux platform. However, there is no requirement that Linux software be open-source. You can get many Windows applications to work on Linux using specific Windows coding software for Linux (such as WINE) but it is generally not a preferable way of playing Windows games compared to running them in Windows on the same machine. Furthermore, WINE is not compatible with PowerPCs including PS3s with Linux installed. A popular option for overcoming Windows compatibility issues is to multi-boot the Linux distro with a version of Windows so that both operating systems are installed on the same PC at once and the user can switch between them.There has been increased development for Linux games in recent years, with many indie games, such as Minecraft, releasing a Linux version. The Humble Indie Bundle typically includes Linux versions of games in addition to Mac and PC. Valve released the beta of their popular Steam platform for Linux (Starting with Ubuntu) in Nov. 2012 after their founder Gabe Newell expressed support for the platform. In 2013, Valve announced that they will be releasing their own Linux distro called SteamOS, which will be installed in all \"Steam Boxes\". It is a derivative of Ubuntu that has an interface similar to Big Picture Mode that can be navigated using a controller. It allows users to stream games from another PC so users can run games that are currently not compatible with Linux. However, support for Linux gaming has been growing over the years, with many games, including indie and AAA titles, having Linux versions being released at launch.The most popular Linux-based OS on the market right now is Android. It is a growing, open source mobile operating system with a growing gaming library. However, it is important to note that most Linux-PC applications are incompatible with Android and vice-verse (without a significant amount of effort).There are many replaceable parts in a PC, which is a main aspect separating them from consoles. PCs may be upgraded and maintained as time passes to keep up with the latest games, and a user's configuration will affect which games they can play. The main parts of a computer are as follows:CPU (Central Processing Unit) - The processing unit that executes operations in a computer. It consists of an integrated circuit built of many transistors that runs on binary code. The CPU communicates with the rest of the computer through the Northbridge via a front side bus. Most medium and high end processors are 64-bit and have several cores which is known as parallel processing. The CPU creates a lot of heat and as a result requires its own dedicated heatsink or waterblock even on a low end computer.GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) - The dedicated graphics rendering device, very important for games. The GPU generally has its own circuit board which is slotted into the motherboard, the processing unit its self is also made up of many transistors and is heavily based on parallel processing. The GPU also uses its own dedicated RAM for storing texture data to be processed. Current generation GPUs are capable of rendering shader model 4.1 processes as part of the DirectX 11 package. Many graphics cards are also compatible with OpenGL.Motherboard - The main circuit board in a PC that all the components connect to. Its through this board that all other components may communicate between each other and is run by a set of North and South bridge chipsets, though newer CPUs actually include an integrated nothrbridge.RAM (Random Access Memory) - Volatile dynamic memory of a system. Data can be temporarily loaded here to be accessed much faster than from the hard drive or even a solid state drive so not to slow the calculations made by the CPU. The current standard is DDR3.PSU (Power Supply Unit) - Supplies power to the PC. Needs to have high enough power (measured in Watts) to run all the components in the system under high load.HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - The main storage device of a PC.SSD (Solid State Drive) - A type of storage similar to a hard drive, but contain no moving parts. Because of this, data stored in solid state drives can be accessed and written quicker than hard drives.Sound Card - An expansion card that processes audio on a separate chip. Most motherboards provide integrated sound chips making sound cards an optional upgrade.ODD (Optical Disc Drive) - The peripheral device that reads optical discs such as DVDs, BDs, and CDs.Case - Houses the components.Monitor - The visual display unit of a computer.Input Devices - Mouse, keyboard, microphone, etc. Because of the uptake of the Xbox 360 most games from 2005 onward will work with the Xbox 360 controller. This is also helped by the fact that the Xbox 360 has a USB connection that allows game developers to easily port the control system from current console games to the PC. In 2014, Microsoft released drivers that allowed Xbox One controllers to work for all 360 controller-compatible games.Cooling - Commonly either water or air based. With standard cooling devices the lowest possible temperature is the ambient temperature, that of the room the system resides in. To further lower the temperature elaborate devices such as Peltier coolers, liquid gases or phase cooling may be installed, though this is best left to the extreme enthusiast due to the risk of most of these options.Unlike their console equivalents most PC games have the ability to vary the graphical settings. This feature is inherent to PCs as few systems bear the same hardware and so the user must tailor the game's settings for optimal performance and visual quality. With modern hardware PCs can often surpass their console counterparts in terms of technical graphics. Recent titles offer the option to set the ideal configuration of a game automatically. Such settings include:Resolution - The number of pixels along the x and y axes to which the game will render.Anti-Aliasing - Raises the quality of the edges of polygon based models using smoothing algorithms.Anisotropic Filtering - Raises the quality of textures viewed from obtuse angles.Texture Quality - General resolution of the paint scheme of each model.Model Quality - General number of polygons used for each model.High Dynamic Range lighting - Allows for dynamic tone mapping in games.Shader Model - Technology a game can use to render advanced visual effects.Vsync - Reduces an artifact known as tearing by synchronizing the frame rate and refresh rate of the monitor.Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.Computers first featured simple titles similar to SpaceWar! or simple text-input games such as Adventure but have since evolved to become the leading platform for cutting-edge game development in the 21st century due to their seemingly limitless potential.Old computers such as the Commodore 64 and NEC PC-98 featured a built-in controller port, for C64 controllers as well as Atari 2600 and other controllers. Many games supported both keyboard and joystick input. Since mice have become standard, they have become the preferable method of input for many games, with various manufacturers branding mice specifically for gaming. Joysticks are still widely used via USB. Early games were simply saved onto floppy disks by a publisher or even the programmer themselves. These disks were sold in Ziploc bags and Vinyl slips; they generally had a bland manual and had nowhere near the shelf-presentation of a modern game. Modern games are distributed mainly on optical discs in hard plastic cases or cardboard boxes. There has been a large surge in digital distribution as well.In the early days of computer gaming, most games were developed by a single programmer, and were often simple text adventures or downgraded ports/clones of more powerful arcade games. PC gaming has since evolved to encompass a wide variety of genres, some faring better than others.The most popular genres that have evolved on the platform are the CRPG (Computer Role-Playing Game), RTS (Real-Time Strategy), and FPS (First-Person Shooter).CRPG's were largely inspired by pen & paper role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. The genre spans early ASCII adventures such as Rogue, action RPG's such as Dragon Slayer and Diablo, and MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs) such as Lineage and World of Warcraft. Freedom is a main element that has evolved with CRPG's. The earlier games were more linear in their approach, sometimes even approaching level design from a distinct \"stages\" standpoint. CRPGs evolved to have 3D dungeons, real time combat, and huge multiplayer, non-linear worlds.Real-Time Strategy games, such as Starcraft and Command & Conquer, is a genre that was at the heart of PC gaming in the 1990s and continues to remain a dominant PC genre in Asian countries like South Korea and China. The genre requires fast-paced clicking using a mouse, making implementation on consoles very difficult; ironically, the game often considered the first RTS, Herzog Zwei, was a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis console game. The genre has certainly seen evolution, but the premise of collecting resources, spawning an army, and sending it into battle, has remained relatively constant throughout RTS history. Today, the most popular RTS games are called MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas), with games such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 being some of the most played games in the world.Steam comprises over 70% of the digital distribution market.The third, and arguably most popular, PC genre is the FPS. After being popularized with iD Software's Wolfenstein 3D, the genre exploded into popularity with Doom. The use of mouse a mouse to look around was later popularized by Duke Nukem 3D and Quake. It's a genre that has been ported to consoles, but still controls better on PC due to quick, precise aiming with mice. Landmark PC FPS games include Doom, Quake, Counter-Strike, and Half-Life.The PC game industry has seen a steady push towards consoles for many years now, due to low sales numbers. These sales are often attributed to illegal downloading as well as the cost of upgrading one's system. The PC industry is largely kept alive by the convenience of having many games at ones fingertips on a PC as well as the superiority of certain genres on the platform.However, PC gaming has seen a massive resurgence of popularity within the last few years thanks to the growing popularity of Steam, the massive success of indie titles such as Minecraft and DayZ, and the rise of eSports with games such as League of Legends, DOTA 2, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive.However, even with retail PC game sales slowing, digital distribution has been expanding within the last few years. Popular digital distribution services like Valve's Steam, EA's Origin, and Desura helped in boosting the sales of PC games and have helped in making many indie games popular. Other digital distributors, like GOG, sell older PC games that either don't sell in retail anymore or are too old to be compatible with newer operating systems. These services allow you to play older games and usually sell them for less than $10 while also being free of DRM. The Humble Indie Bundle and other alternatives have been a great resource in downloading numerous indie and retail games for prices set by the end user. The majority of the proceeds go to the game developers as well as numerous charities. These type of services help in having an easy way to play PC games and having developers keep in touch with their communities.NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.A primary issue with PC gaming is the barrier to entry due to cost. Pricing of a PC depends on what type of performance a user wants when it comes to playing games, but for people who want to play games at maximum settings, it can cost at least $1000 to build and up to $3000 to buy from a manufacturer. In order to play some of the biggest, most graphically impressive games on PC at maximum settings with a stable framerate, it may require a user to upgrade their computer components every 2-3 years. However, thanks to better optimization of games and the creation of lower level APIs such as AMD's Mantle, the barrier of entry for PC gaming has been decreasing and lower-end hardware can be used to run games with decent performance.The ability to selectively upgrade hardware also gives PC gamers a flexibility absent in console gaming. Users can upgrade RAM, GPU or hard drives to make their computers more powerful as the games become more demanding. In turn, this flexibility and constant increase in performance allows developers to create games that can fully utilize the latest hardware, often leading to more complex or better looking games.One huge problem reported by publishers with PC gaming is the excessive piracy of games. Bootleg copies of games have been a problem since the introduction of the personal computer. Many computer experts were able to copy floppy disks and distribute them to either share with friends or profit off them. Since the introduction of the internet, it has been easier to distribute pirated software than ever before (including games). Bittorrent sites make it easier for people to put up game files where everyone can download and play.Although piracy ranges across the world, the areas with the most piracy are developing nations. These are areas that either have poor game distribution or have gamers that are too poor to afford many games. Piracy has also gone up since the economic crash of 2008.There are many measures that game publishers use in attempts to prevent piracy. Floppy disk games of the 1980's included items in their game boxes called \"feelies\", or items necessary to have in order to play the game. Some games required the player to look in the instruction manual and type in a specific word to play the game while others had the player decrypt a code displayed on a screen using one of the items in the box. As CD games became more popular and CD copiers were gaining traction, CD keys, unique codes to identify legitimately purchased games, were introduced. Sometimes CD keys are used to access certain parts of a game such as multiplayer and Live features in Games for Windows Live games. There have been many issues with CD keys. If you were to lose your CD key and needed to reinstall a game, you had to buy your game again. This type of security did not last long because pirates were finding ways to create fake CD keys that they could use to play pirated games. Digital Distribution has made CD keys mostly obsolete.This led game publishers and various third parties to develop forms of Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is digtal software protection that prevents the user from using copied game discs and downloaded disc images or installing games on multiple machines. Some early forms of DRM may interfere with some applications such as disc drive emulation software used for mounting disc images.Activation failure screen for GTA IV.There have been controversial uses of DRM within the last few years. In 2008, EA announced that they are going to use a new version of SecuROM DRM that limits the number of simultaneous activated installs for all of their new PC games (starting with Mass Effect and Spore). Since then there has been a huge controversy over DRM, even questioning the legality of it.In 2009, Ubisoft introduced a new DRM that will require you to be online at all times when playing a game. If you are disconnected from the internet for any reason, gameplay will stop. The first games to utilize the new DRM were Assassin's Creed II and Silent Hunter 5. As of 2011, Ubisoft decided to discontinue and retool their online DRM system with the release of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and was relaunched with the release of Driver: San Francisco. Today, Ubisoft has their own digital platform, Uplay, that is needed to access many of their games.Common complaints about this type of DRM are losing game progress and not being able to play when an internet connection is unavailable. Other companies are using similar DRM including EA with Command and Conquer 4 and Blizzard with StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and Diablo III. Both C&C4 and D3 require a constant, active connection to the host servers, but Blizzard's implementation in SC2 allows offline play of the single player campaign and AI versus modes with achievement functionality disabled.Many digital distributors feature their own DRM. Steam requires users to connect to their servers at least once and enable offline mode before playing games offline. In Steam's offline mode, achievements are deactivated. Microsoft's Games For Windows Live has similar restrictions.",

    "description": "iPhone is a smartphone designed by Apple, sold in many countries and on many mobile carriers. What makes iPhone special from past mobile phones is its minimalist design and heavily reliance on a touch screen instead of buttons. iPhone sports many features that make it attractive as not only a phone, but a general purpose computing device. More importantly, iPhone has recently gained a massive foothold in the handheld gaming market through the App Store, allowing users to easily download apps from the device itself. With iPhone's massive popularity and considered by many to be their primary gaming platform, major publishers such as Gameloft, EA, Epic Games and Sega have all released games for iPhone.The iPhone is a very capable platform in terms of processing power. It has a 620 MHz ARM 1176 underclocked to 400 MHz processor, 128 MB eDRAM as well as a PowerVR MBX graphics processing unit. This allows it to run 3D and sprite-based games which put most phones' graphical capabilities to shame. Graphics are run through OpenGL, however it is the less-powerful Embedded System version. The iPhone 3GS has a 833 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 underclocked to 600 MHz, 256 MB eDRAM, and a PowerVR SGX GPU.The iPhone 4 has the ARM Cortex-A8CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX 535 GPU and 515 MB eDRAM.There are some issues for running games on the iPhone, the main one being a lack of a tactile input. The iPhone is controlled via a combination of a touch screen, which can recognize multiple points of contact, as well as an accelerometer, which can sense movement of the device. These methods of input can work well for many genres, including racing, puzzle, and adventure games. However the lack of physical button-based input can inhibit more traditional action-based games, platformers, etc. due to the finger needing to obscure the screen. Virtual buttons may be used instead, but that takes up space on the rather small screen and lacks tactile feedback and the ability to be pressure sensitive. Unlike the Nintendo DS, the iPhone's screen is not sensitive to physical pressure, but only disturbances through bioelectric contact such as skin -- the former being known as resistive and the latter capacitive. This is why using a plastic stylus or most inorganic objects will not register input. Since the original iPhone release, Apple have upgraded the model with three new releases, the iPhone 3G boasted a new streamlined design, replacing the aluminum backing for a more suited black plastic. It also introduced 3G to the iPhone, which was a feature that many critics complained about the original not having, considering it was a smartphone and a GPS. The iPhone 3GS released in 2009 claimed to be \"twice as fast\" as the 3G, it also has a 3.0 megapixel camera that takes stills and video, compared to the iPhone and the 3G's fixed focus 2.0 megapixel camera, which could not record video. Additionally, the 3GS added a digital compass.In June 2010, the iPhone 4 was released. The iPhone was vastly improved now, with a faster CPU, a higher resolution \"retina\" display, noise suppressing dual microphones, a 5.0 megapixel camera and a newly added front-facing camera, longer battery life, and a design change which made it distinct from older models.On October 4 2011, Apple announced the iPhone 4S. Changes include a new 8MP camera,1080p video recording, an improved antenna, Apple's A5 dual core processor and Siri, a voice controlled assistant. It released on October 14, 2011.The iPhone 5 was released on September 21, 2012. The phone is slimmer, lighter, and also introduced the first 4\" screen. It was also the first iPhone to support LTE. Apple put a their new A6 processor, and added 1GB of RAM.The iPhone 5s and 5c were announced on September 10, 2013 and launched on September 20, 2013. The iPhone 5s uses a 64-bit A7 processor, while the lower-end iPhone 5c uses the A6 processor previously used in the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5s also adds a fingerprint scanner, which is not present on the iPhone 5c. Fingerprint data is stored within a \"secure enclave\" on the A7 chip.Jailbreaking is a process that allows the iPhone and iPod Touch to run unsigned code on, bypassing Apple's official distribution platform, the App Store. Once jailbroken, iPhone users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store due to Apple's rules.Jailbreaking is condemned by Apple and will cause any standing warranty on an iPhone or iPod Touch product to become null and void. The iPod Touch looks a lot like the iPhone, but there are a few key differences between the two. The most notable of these differences is the fact that the iPod touch does not have a GSM radio built into it, and therefore cannot use a cellular network with which to make phone calls or access the internet, though it does include Wi-Fi. The first generations did not have a built-in camera or microphone, but the second generation (2G, 2008) of the hardware does include an internal speaker and adds support for an external microphone. The fourth generation (4G, 2010) now includes a built-in microphone and also a camera which can record both images and video. Like the iPhone, the iPod touch runs iPhone OS. The iPhone OS 3.0 on the iPod touch unlocks Bluetooth (for 2G touch), landscape keyboard in more apps, peer-to-peer gameplay, and several other new features. The iPod Touch functions much like the iPhone, but is slightly smaller, lighter, and can be purchased without a phone contract. Game Center is Apple's gaming platform for the iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad, which was announced as part of the iPhone OS 4.0 on April 8, 2010. The new platform will work as a social gaming network, with the ability to track friends and invite them to games, matchmaking, leaderboards and achievements. Game Center will replace other gaming networks on the iPhone such as OpenFeint, and allow for a more wholesome experience. The network was supposed to launch as part of iPhone OS 4.0 in June 2010, but was delayed to September 2010.",

    "description": "Broadcast Satellaview XThe Nintendo Satellaview, or Broadcast Satellaview X (BS-X), is a satellite game and news delivery add-on for the Super Famicom, which was only released in Japan. It allows players to subscribe and connect to St. GIGA and download games and news updated from 4-7PM. The unit was released in 1995 and retailed for ¥14,000. Some games could only be played at certain times, while others were downloaded to the BS-X Cassette, a small memory cartridge. The service was supported up until 2000 with the last game release being in 1999. Sales numbers are unknown for the device, although it gained a good deal of support.The Satellaview and its box.The Satellaview itself was a bulky add-on that snapped into the expansion port of the bottom of the Super Famicom. It was the first device to actually use the expansion port. A power transfer bracket was supplied which connected the Super Famicom to the BS-X to supply power so a separate adapter wasn't needed. An Satellaview-branded AV selector is also included with the package. The BS-X Cassette, the units storage device, could hold around 512kb of data. A deluxe package was available that included an 8Mbit memory pak, which was necessary for larger games or multiple game saves. The BS-X was the result of the failed SFC CD add-on. The CD add-on sparked interest in using the expansion port for something, but instead of a different storage medium, the developers created a digital distribution service in conjunction with the St. GIGA satellite radio station.Updates were only broadcast between 4PM and 7PM (JST) by St. GIGA satellite radio. These updates contained game news, new games, quizzes and some advertisements. Quizzes had high score lists on the network and highest scorers could receive prizes such as telephone cards or a memory pak. Most games were only available for a limited time, being released in parts over the course of an amount of days or weeks (usually 4). For example, a game might have 25% of the world map revealed in it's first week, with the full world map available by the end of the month. Games on the Satellaview are often exclusive to the platform and many have not been released anywhere else; this makes units with exclusive games on them especially valuable to collectors.An example of a voice-acted scene that may appear.Some games had a live, satellite streaming voice broadcast along with them, much like a radio drama and a coinciding real time in-game clock. Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban for example, had live voice acted cut scenes, as well as voice acted optional side quests. These could only be played at certain times and not saved to the BS-X Cassette. There is a thirteen-minute window during which a side quest character can be saved, and the voice would only play if the player was on the same screen. It is assumed that the voice actor simply repeated the cries for help for thirteen minutes and it was streamed if the player was \"within earshot\" in the game. Some games, such as the BS Zelda games were rebroadcast, but since the St. GIGA subscription ended in 2000, it is no longer possible to play these games in their original format.Other than Satellaview-exclusive releases, there were also standard Super Famicom games broadcast, as well as vastly updated versions of popular games or \"remixed\" versions. There were a few original games for the device as well. Despite being a seemingly obscure add-on, the Satellaview garnered quite a bit of support, even getting third party releases from Square and Enix.BS Zelda no DensetsuBS Fire Emblem: Akaneia SenkiBS Mario USABS Zelda no DensetsuBS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no SekibanBS F-Zero 2 Grand PrixMario Excite BikeRadical Dreamers: Nusumenai HōsekiWario's WoodsThe four chapters of BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki were later remade and included in Fire Emblem: Shin Monshou no Nazo on the Nintendo DS as a bonus.",

    "description": "In 1995 Shoshinkai game show (Space world today) in Japan, that Nintendo first announced their plans to release the 64DD (Dynamic Drive) system. In 1997 Shigeru Miyamoto gave more details about the systems abilities and forthcoming games, of which most were never released. The disc drive add-on connected to the Nintendo 64’s EXT port located underneath the console. It wasn’t until 1999, towards the end of the N64’s production life, that 64DD add-on became available to the public. The 64DD was never available outside of Japan.Unfortunately, Nintendo created the system using a technology that was all but defunct by the time of it‘s release. Offering an alternate format to the cartridge which utilized rewritable magnetic discs rather than the CD-ROM format of Nintendo’s main rivals. While the technology may have seemed fanciful to audiences outside of Japan, Nintendo already had experience utilizing disk drives with their systems (i.e. the Famicom Disk System). The format also shared with cartridges the benefit of difficulty in pirating while alleviating the space constraints of traditional cartridges and the loading times endemic to the CD-ROM based systems of the time. However production costs for the magnetic discs used with the system remained higher than that off CD-ROM media and this had the effect of tempering 3rd party developer interest since the ubiquitous CD-ROM disk could be made for pennies and while offering even more space than was available via the technology offered in the 64DD.64DD Console Box.Nintendo offered the 64DD through a mail order subscription service in Japan that cost subscribers ¥2,500 a month, for a 12 month contract. What they got for that price was the 64DD hardware unit, including a 4MB RAM expansion pack, a modem cartridge including the cables, software and access to the RAND net online service. Also games and additional software programs were to be shipped out to clients periodicallyThe magnetic disc had a storage capacity of 64MB and were a lot like Zip disc’s for PC‘s. The main advantage of using these discs is that they are encased in a tough shell, so they were a lot more durable than a CD and were a lot cheaper to manufacture than the N64 cartridge (still a lot more than the CD though), also load times were very quick, rarely exceeding five second loading times, with three or four seconds being the average speed for a game to load up. Along with the magnetic disc, the 64DD also had some interesting features that promised to revolutionize the gaming industry and Nintendo‘s N64 platform.The system was obviously designed to play new and original 64DD game releases, and nine full 64DD games were actually released (four of which were different versions of Mario paint) for the system. But it wasn’t the new game releases that got video games players interested and intrigued with 64DD platform. It was the concept of the expansion kit disc’s, that provided further content for previously released Nintendo 64 games. The only expansion kit released that utilized the power of both systems was the F-Zero X Expansion Kit. With many others being proposed, but never released.The 64DD’s online feature was made possible by Nintendo creating the RAND network, which was a little bit like satellite view for the Super Nintendo. Everything you needed to get the 64DD online was included in the starter pack on it’s release in late 1999. Part of this package was the Nexus developed internet modem that plugged into the N64’s cartridge slot. Once you were connected to internet you could take advantage of number of options, which included a web browser, access to a member’s only information page, an online message board for communicating with other 64DD users, the option of sending messages to the actual game programmers, beta testing, listening to music online (that was of a CD quality) and an online magazine that covered news, sports and weather. When it came to online gaming they had the choice, to either play against other people or simply observe others playing games or applications. The most popular feature on the RAND net, was it’s ability for users to share and swap what they had created using the Mario Artist creative programs with other 64DD subscribers.64DD Magnetic Disc.In February of 2001 the RAND net service was canceled. Even though it enjoyed moderate success, with a cult status in Japan, the somewhat limited user base just wasn’t enough to justify its continued existence as a platform. The service was offered for free after the cancellation date was announced by Nintendo up until the plug was finally pulled. Once the RAND net service was disabled, Nintendo began buying back all the related software and hardware, which would be useless with out the service, but all other DD hardware and software could be kept.The 64DD add-on only managed to sell 15,000 units in Japan and was classified as a commercial failure for Nintendo. Often being compared to all the add-ons Sega piled onto the Genesis/Mega Drive (e.g. Sega 32X). Nintendo didn’t completely walk away from this empty handed though, and if anything the 64DD was more of an experiment giving them a chance to trial new ideas (online games and internet access), some of which became standard features in Nintendo's future products and consoles.The 4MB RAM cartridge took on a new life of it’s own, being released to the rest of the world as an expansion pack for the N64 console and was bundled in with selected titles to help enhance the graphical performance of the system. The 64DD was an interesting concept for its time, which had massive potential, and maybe things would have turned out a lot differently if the system wasn’t delayed for such a long period of time and more support was given to the platform by 3rd party developers.Prior to it's fate as a comercial failure the 64DD had a variety of titles being worked on for it. The following is a list of games and their fate* Dragon Warrior VII (released as a Playstation Title)*Hybrid Heaven (Eventually released as an N64 cartridge)* Mission Impossible (Eventually released as an N64 cartridge)* Mother 3 (released as a Game Boy Advance Title)* Pokemon Snap (released on cartridge)* Pokemon Stadium (Released on N64, Exclusively in Japan.)*Pokemon Stadium 2 (Released on N64. Retitled as Pokemon Stadium for North America)* Super Mario 64 2 (Ultimately canceled after significant work was put into it as a Gamecube title. Some have speculated that Mario Galaxy was a direct result of such work)* Super Mario RPG 2 (Released as Paper Mario on cartridge)* Resident Evil 0 (Release on Gamecube)* Ultra Donkey Kong (Released as Donkey Kong 64 on cartridge)* Ura-Zelda (Split into two. with Majora's Mask being the \"new game\" released on cartridge and Zelda: Master Quest being the enchanted remake released on Gamecube)*Zelda 64 (Released a Ocarina of Time on N64.)In addition, add-ons for Quest 64 and Automobile Lamborghini were also in the works Four additional Mario Artist titles were also planned. Due to its extremely limited release only in Japan the system is highly sought after by collectors. The games usually sell for around $80-$100 but can also go for over $200. The system itself is much harder to come by and usually sells for $1000+ if in good condition with all inserts.",

The Pippin was based on the hardware and software architecture of the second generation Power Macintosh. It was intended to not only be a video game console, but also a complete multimedia experience. It could play music CDs and other non-game software titles. It was meant to be an advanced multimedia PC that was easy to use and affordable for most households. Since most homes had a television set in the home already, Apple believed that people would be willing to invest in a low cost computer that connected to equipment that was already present in the home. The Pippin was made a platform that Apple made available to third party manufacturers under license, similar to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The only manufacturers that made Pippins were Bandai in Japan and the United States, and Katz Media in Europe. The Pippin lasted only two years, and ceased production in 1997. It is widely regarded as a failure. Only 18 titles were released for the Pippin in the United States, although Bandai released as many as 80 in Japan. All Pippin titles could be used on Macintosh computers of the time, although you could not use any Macintosh software on the Pippin without certain modifications. Through heavy modification, some DOS and Windows based programs could also be used on the Pippin. The Pippin units released in Japan were white colored and were called ATMARK units. The Pippins released in the United States were black and were called @WORLD units. Both units were compatible with numerous accessories, including floppy disk drives and printers.

The bulb used to light screen takes up so much room in the device that it is somewhat of a misnomer to be called \"pocket.\" The name XPG was intended to be the systems proper name but the system is usually referred to simply as \"R-Zone.\"The R-Zone Head Gear was Tiger's attempt at providing a virtual reality experience for the player.  It was marketed as such, but in reality, it only resembles virtual reality in cosmetic design. It plays simple LCD games via a mirror reflecting light through the game screen into one eyeball.  The controller was wired to the headset and provided the power with 4 AAA batteries. The controller has volume and brightness dials on the bottom, as well as a slot to store an extra game cartridge. The Head Gear is largely criticized for being almost exclusively cosmetic. The headset adds nothing to the gameplay experience and limits the viewable screen to one eye.The R-Zone Super Screen was a table top version of the original R-Zone XPG. Tiger scrapped the virtual reality marketing campaign and tried to improve the LCD console as much as they could with the Super Screen.  The big changes are that the screen is much larger and magnified, the d-pad was scrapped in favor of 4 buttons and that a color filter could be placed over some games to give the backgrounds more color.  All movement on the screen is still black. Also, the screen is directly backlit so there is no more mirror; the major effect being that other players can see the game since it doesn't need to be viewed at a specific angle. One spare backlight was included with the console. The beastly device ran on 4 C batteries and can hardly be considered a handheld.",

    "description": "The BBC Micro was a microcomputer platform, first introduced in 1981, with Acorn Computers winning the contract for the BBC's Computer Literacy Project ahead of Sir Clive Sinclair and the ZX Spectrum. It was a way for Acorn to quickly make money thanks to the BBC name. Initially code-named \"Proton\" it became a great success in the UK, with every secondary school and primary school soon having access to one. At the time, the success of the BBC Micro made the UK the most computer-literate country in the world. Two revisions were released in November, 1981 the entry-level Model A at £235 and standard Model B at £335. Model B's included additional RAM a second processor. Later the BBC Master was released with more RAM and OS enhancements. The BBC B+ was released in 1984 which featured double the RAM found in the BBC B.The BBC Micro is powered by a 6502 processor, the same one found in the Commodore PET and VIC-20 as well as the Atari 400 and 800.Perhaps the best remembered game for the system was Acornsoft's Elite, the first fully 3D space trading and combat game. It was developed by Ian Bell and David Braben. Musician Martin Galway and director Chris Roberts also started out on the system, collaborating on the Superior Software game, Stryker's Run. Game adaptations of popular BBC TV shows like Doctor Who were also produced.The BBC is looking for a microcomputer platform for their show The Computer Programme. It must be a platform that has graphics and is able to show text.Acorn upgrades its Atom system as to be on par with what the BBC was asking for. Acorn wins the contract and starts building machines for the BBC. The BBC Microcomputer System is born.The BBC Micro gets some competition ( ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64) and Acorn has trouble answering customer demand.Despite releasing multiple versions of the BBC, Acorn Computers is almost bankrupt and is bought by Olivetti.The final model of the BBC is released but is already technically inferior to other machines such as the Amiga. This is the end of the BBC Micro. The Model A, while having the same graphics chip as the Model B variants, was unable to run Modes 0-3 due to the lack of sufficient memory ",

    "description": "PC-98 is a series of 16/32-bit Japanese personal computers, designed by NEC, but also licensed to other companies. In contrast to its PC-88 predecessor, the PC-98 was initially created as a business machine, but over time it eventually became popular with game developers. The PC-98 is based around Intel 8086 and compatible processors, but the design is proprietary, and it is not compatible with the IBM PC or clones, although versions of DOS and Windows were ported to it.The system has a very large library of video games, consisting of more than 4,000 commercial titles and countless more doujin (indie) titles. The games and system are difficult to find outside of Japan, even on eBay. There are a few sites however that sell the games and systems.When the PC-98 was launched in 1982, it was initially priced at ¥298,000 (about $1400 in 1982 dollars, equivalent to about $3400 in 2012 dollars). The PC-98 computer platform eventually went on to sell more than 18 million units in Japan by 1999, surpassing the Commodore 64 (17 million units) as the best-selling home computer system of the 20th century.Laptop versions of the PC-9801 were also being sold in the late 1980s. The first was the PC-98 LT, one of the first mass-market laptops, released in 1986. It is considered the world's first major laptop PC. The world's first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite. By 1990, the 32-bit PC-9801 NC model became the world's first laptop/notebook computer with a colour TFT LCD display.In the early 1980's, the PC-9801 was more advanced than Western computer platforms. The PC-98 featured the first dedicated computer GPU chip, the NEC 7220 GDC, along with a 16-bit NEC CPU. It featured higher VGA display resolutions (initially up to 640x475 pixels, then up to 1024x1024 in 1983, and then up to 1120x750 pixels by 1985) in order to more accurately display Japanese text, a wider color palette (16 colors displayed out of a 4096 color palette), Yamaha FM synthesis sound chips for higher-quality audio, and a modem for online internet access.NEC attempted to introduce the NEC PC-9801 in North America, where it was re-branded as the NEC APC in 1982. NEC, the largest semiconductor company of the 1980s, marketed the APC III as the most powerful computer on the market and more reliable machine than leading competitor IBM's PC platform, with the APC III offering twice as much speed (8 MHz), storage (720 KB floppy disks) and resolution (640x400 pixels) at around the same price. Despite the superior hardware compared to its competitors, the APC III eventually failed to make in impact in North America, largely due to the rise of IBM PC clones, which also negatively impacted IBM's share of the North American PC market.While the NEC APC was unsuccessful in North America, it became successful in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in Australia.The PC-98 was later technically surpassed by fellow Japanese rivals Sharp and Fujitsu when they launched their own more powerful 16/32-bit computers, the Sharp X68000 and FM Towns, in 1987 and 1989, respectively.In response, the PC-98 began using 32-bit Intel CPU processors from 1987 and supported the CD-ROM format from 1989. While both rival computers were capable of more advanced, arcade quality graphics (especially in the X68000's case) and/or greater multimedia features (in the FM Towns' case), neither computer platform was able to dethrone the PC-98 as the Japanese computer market leader.Just as IBM-compatible PC's were on the rise in the mid-1990s, NEC came back by releasing the first 3D graphics accelerator cards on the market, initially for the PC-98. In 1995, NEC released the first 3D graphics card, the PC-FXGA (PC-FX Game Accelerator), exclusively for the PC-98. This allowed the PC-98 to produce the most advanced 3D graphics seen on a home system up until that time, with a polygon rendering performance surpassing the PlayStation console and even rivaling the then upcoming Nintendo 64; in contrast, rival early 1996 3D graphics accelerators for IBM PC clones, such as Creative Labs' 3D Blaster and NVIDIA's NV1, were unable to rival the PlayStation's 3D graphics. The PC-FXGA was originally intended for both the PC-98 computer and the PC-FX console, with as a homebrew development kit for the PC-FX console, allowing the PC-98 to play PC-FX games. However, the PC-FX console lacked the 3D graphical capabilities of the PC-FXGA card, due to the FXGA's HuC6273 graphics chip (originally intended for the PC-FX) never actually being used by the PC-FX console.The PC-FXGA was the most powerful 3D graphics card on the market up until it was surpassed by NEC's successor, the PowerVR, in early 1996. Unlike the PC-FXGA, the succeeding PowerVR was no longer exclusive to the PC-98, but supported both the PC-98 and IBM-compatible PC's. The PowerVR was able to produce near arcade quality 3D graphics, demonstrated by a near arcade quality port of Namco's Rave Racer, though this PowerVR port was later cancelled. The PowerVR would not be rivaled until the arrival of the 3dfx Voodoo graphics card for IBM-compatible PC's in late 1996. Though both the PowerVR and Voodoo were more or less evenly matched when it came to 3D capabilities, it was the Voodoo that became the most popular graphics card line-up of the late 1990s, due to the PowerVR's lack of third-party software support. Besides the PowerVR, the PC-98 very few other 3D graphics cards supported the PC-98.The PC-98 would continue to dominate the Japanese computer market until the late 1990s, when the arrival of Microsoft Windows 95 made it possible for IBM-compatible PC's to accurately output Japanese text, leading to the rise of IBM-compatible PC's in Japan and marking the end of the 'Golden Age' of Japanese computer gaming.By the end of the 1990s, the PC-98's dwindling market share as well as NEC's greater support for the growing IBM PC market eventually led to the PC-98 slowly losing ground to IBM-compatible PC's. In 1997, the PC-98 NX became one of the first computer platforms produced in line with the PC97 System Design Guide standard, which would later become the worldwide standard for IBM-compatible PC's. As a result, PC-98 standards eventually merged with IBM-compatible PC standards, bringing an end to the traditional PC-98 platform by the early 2000s, succeeded by IBM-compatible PC-98 NX computers which are still manufactured through to the present day.Main CPU (Central Processing Unit) processor:1982: 16-bit NEC μPD8086 (i8086 compatible) @ 5 MHz1983: 16-bit Intel 8086-2 @ 5-8 MHz1984: 16-bit

Alongside the FM-7 and the NEC PC-8801, it was considered one of the \"big 3\" of Japanese personal computers in the 1980s. The X1 was Sharp's successor to the Sharp MZ, released in 1978In 1984, Sharp released the X1 Turbo series with high resolution graphics (640x400, while X1 had 640x200).

In 1986, Sharp released the X1 turbo Z series with a 4096 color analog RGB monitor.The X1 Twin had NEC's PC-Engine in the cabinet.

    "description": "The demo screen for the FM-7The FM-7, an acronym for \"Fujitsu Micro 7,\" was the second home computer released by the Japanese computing company Fujitsu. It was released in Japan in November 1982, for ¥126,000 ($500 in 1982 dollars, or $1200 in 2013 dollars). Alongside the Sharp X1 and NEC PC-8801, it was considered to be one of the big three Japanese personal computers of the early 1980s.The most notable model for computer gaming was the FM-77 AV, which in 1985 introduced a simultaneous display of 4096 colors, surpassing the 8 color display of other 8-bit home computers at the time.The FM-7 was released almost simultanously with the FM-11 EX (intended for businesses), and was preceded by the FM-8 (Fujitsu's first home computer release). Fujitsu were also later responsible for the FM Towns, the powerful 32-bit successor to the FM-7.The FM-7 was similar to Radio Shack's TRS-80 Color Computer (colloquially referred to as the \"CoCo\") in some ways, especially CPU processor (both used the 8-bit Motorola 6809) and included features. One such feature is F-BASIC, very similar to the CoCo's \"Microsoft CoCo BASIC.\" F-BASIC is essentially a simplistic programming language, including a katakana and kanji character set, graphics manipulation, and music.There were several different versions of the FM-7 released following the initial release in 1982, including the FM-New 7 and FM-77.A major breakthrough for computer gaming came in 1985, with the release of the FM-77 AV, the first computer model to break the 8-color barrier of 8-bit computers and achieve a simultaneous display of 4096 colors. In addition, the FM-77 AV also came with a built-in Yamaha FM synthesis sound board, providing higher-quality audio.FM-7 models included:FM-77 AV FM-New 7 (1984)FM-77 (1984)FM-77 L2 (1985)FM-77 L4 (1985)FM-77 AV (1985)FM-77 AV20 (1986)FM-77 AV40 (1986)FM-77 AV20 EX (1987)FM-77 AV40 EX (1987)FM-77 AV40 SX (1988)Main CPU (Central Processing Unit) processor: 1982: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 4.9 - 8 MHz1984: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 8 MHz1985: Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz (equivalent to MBL 68B09 @ 8 MHz)GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processor: 1982: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 2 MHz1984: Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz1985: Fujitsu MMR (Memory Mapping Register), Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHzOptional CPU processor: Zilog Z80 (8-bit)Main RAM (Random Access Memory)1982: 64 KB1984: 64-256 KB1985: 128-256 KB1986: 128 KB / 192 KB / 448 KBVideo RAM (VRAM) memory: 1982: 48 KB1985: 96 KB1986: 96-144 KB1987: 96-192 KB1988: 192 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) memory: 48 KB (1982), 72 KB (1985)Storage: Default: 10-20 MB hard disk drive (1982), 1x-2x 3.5\" DD floppy disk drives (1984)Optional: Cassette tape, 5.25\" floppy disk3.5\" DD (double-density) floppy disks: 320 KB each (1984), 640 KB each (1986)Maximum display resolution: 640x200 pixels (1982), 640x400 pixels (1984)Maximum color palette: 8 (1982), 16 (1984), 4096 (1985), 262,144 (1986)Simultaneous display colors: 1982: 3 colors (monochrome), 8 colors (4-bit color)1984: 8 colors at 640x200, 2 colors at 640x4001985: 4096 colors at 320x200, 16 colors at 640x200, 2 colors at 640x4001986: 4096 colors at 320x200, 16 colors at 640x200, 8 colors at 640x4001987: 4096 colors at 320x200, 32 colors at 640x200, 16 colors at 640x400Monitors: Multi-monitor support for 2-6 monitors (1985)Video digitization: Supported (1985), Standard (1988)1982: General Instruments AY-3-8910 sound chip (PSG synthesizer, 3 channels, 8 octaves)1985: Yamaha sound board (FM synthesis, 3 channels), AY-3-8910 sound chipInterface: Tape, RGB, RS232, Joystick (2), ROM/RAM cartridges, BUSIPSJ Computer Museum article on FM-77 AV",

    "description": "Nintendo 3DS Nintendo announced the Nintendo 3DS on March 23, 2010. No software was yet revealed; the only details in the announcement were that the system will be available in Japan by the end of March 2011, and that it will display stereoscopic 3D without requiring special glasses, and it is backwards compatible with existing DS and DSi software. The system itself was revealed at Nintendo's E3 2010 media briefing by Satoru Iwata.The 3DS's graphical capabilities are said to be comparable to the Wii, but the added benefit of modern shaders. This is in addition to stereoscopic 3D, adding a sense of 3-dimensional depth to the image. The 3D can be adjusted with a slider to fit each person's individual eye focus. Much like the volume slider, turning the 3D slider all the way down disables the 3D effect altogether.The 3DS also features two cameras, allowing the user to take 3D images. The 3DS can also play downloaded 3D movies, and can connect wirelessly to the internet to access the Nintendo eshop and video streaming/download services.Note: Install base in the platform details tab reflects the latest official cumulative Nintendo 3DS platform family LTD numbers minus the latest New Nintendo 3DS/XL LTD numbers.Width: 5.3\" (13.4cm), height: 2.9\" (7.4cm), depth when folded: 0.8\" (2.1cm)Weight: ~8 ounces (235g)Top Screen: 3.5\" parallax barrier LCD screen with 800x240 resolution. 3D capability.Bottom Screen: 3\" LCD screen with 320x240 resolution.

The Nintendo 3DS XL launched in North America on August 19, 2012 (for US$199,99) and July 28 in both Europe (€199,99/£179.99) and Japan (¥18,900) as well as Australia/New Zealand on August 23, 2012 (for AU$249,95).46% size increase (width: 15.6cm, height: 9.3cm, depth when folded: 2.2cm, weight: 336g)90% bigger screens (top screen: 4.88 inches, bottom screen: 4.18 inches)Size of the +Control Pad, face and shoulder buttons has been slightly increasedbattery life increased to between 3.5 to 6.5 hours (3DS software) and 5 to 8 hours (DS software)bundled SD Card upgraded from 2GB to a 4GB CardIncludes an updated Stylus that is not retractable and rests at the side again, akin to DSlite/DSiAC power adapter sold separately in Japan and Europe, bundled in North AmericaCompatible with DSi/DSiXL/3DS AC adapterAll user data (including activity log, play coins, NNID/eShop activity) can be transferred from the original 3DS to the 3DS XL, using System TransferDS and Virtual Console games that are selected to run in 1:1 native resolution will look better due to the bigger screen size, fixing a major complaint about the original 3DSNintendo has released a XL version of the Circle Pad Pro.Weighs almost 50 percent more than the original model 3DS. (336 grams compared to the original 3DS's 230 grams)Nintendo 2DS Officially revealed by Nintendo on August 28th, 2013 via press release, the 2DS is second revision of the 3DS. The main differences are that the top screen does no longer displays stereoscopic 3D at all, and the system does not have a clamshell design like the 3DS and 3DSXL before it. The 2DS was released on October 12th, 2013 in North America for US$129.99, Europe for €129.99/£109.99, and Australia/New Zealand for AU$149.95 and was released in South Korea, in a bundle with Pokémon X/Y, on December 7th, 2013 for 180,000 won (~US$170).Width: 14.4cm (5.7\"), Height: 12.7cm (5.0\"), Depth: 2.03cm (0.80\"), Weight: 260g (9.2oz)Can play all 3DS games and DS games.Despite not having a 3D screen, it still has two cameras on the rear so it can take 3D photos and videos.Both screens are the same size as the original (not XL) 3DS.Shares the same software as the 3DS/3DSXL, except the WiFi toggle was put in with the screen brightness controls on the home screen.Comes with a 4GB SD card.Has a 1300mAh battery, the same as the 3DS, and lasts around 3 to 5.5 hours (3DS software) and 5 to 9 hours (DS Sofware).Because of the non-clamshell design, the 2DS has a \"sleep mode\" switch on the bottom.New Nintendo 3DS & New Nintendo 3DS LLThis fourth model of the Nintendo 3DS was announced by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in a Nintendo Direct on August 29, 2014.New Nintendo 3DS comes in both the classic pocket-size of the original Nintendo 3DS and an XL variant. The New Nintendo 3DS adds a variety of buttons, features, refinements.The New Nintendo 3DS models launch in Japan on October 11, 2014. The New 3DS will retail for 16,000 Yen and the New 3DS LL will retail for 18,800 Yen.The new models will launch in North America and Europe in 2015.New Nintendo 3DS will receive exclusive software taking advantage of the new CPU and new control options, notably a New 3DS version of the Wii RPG Xenoblade Chronicles. There will also be future games compatible with the previous Nintendo 3DS models that will be enhanced when played on a New Nintendo 3DS/XL.

The concept of 3D intrigued them, and they continued experimenting ways to make it a serious way to play over the next 20 years. For every single new console they have made, they have tried to introduce some sort of 3D functionality. Most of these attempts weren't announced due to they not being up to their standards, especially after the commercial flop of the Virtual Boy in 1995.It wasn't until it came time to create the successor to the Nintendo DS that they found a way to utilize it. The 3DS did not actually begin development as a 3D focused console, but instead it was just meant to be a successor to the DS with next-gen graphics, which Miyamoto called \"the typical evolution of a game device.\" However, without a good 'hook' to justify the release of a new console when the DS and its revisions were becoming the most popular game systems ever made, the system was pushed back until they felt it was appropriate.Miyamoto and Iwata wanted to include 3D in this new console, but they had to make sure it was there from the outset, and not released as an add-on peripheral to the device in order to increase the audience for it from the beginning. By the time the 3DS was being planned, LCD devices that could output autostereostopic images (where 3D images can be displayed without the need for 3D glasses) were already in development, and Nintendo decided to be one of the first to try the technology out.The developers at Nintendo were astonished by the new technology, with Miyamoto calling it the same feeling when he saw Yoshi first appear on the 16-bit screen of the Game Boy Advance back during its development. Miyamoto also said it alleviates many of the harder parts of developing 3D games, especially Mario games, where a lot of effort has to be made to make the three-dimensional world that Mario traverses to be easily interpreted by the player.The 3D slider.According to him, they had to use many tricks to make it easy for the player to hit a floating '?' block in previous 3D Mario games, but when they experimented on the 3DS, it became very natural. He said it was the perfect time to bring back their previous franchises that started out in 3D to the 3DS, because it would allow him to create easier to play, yet more difficult sequels to the original games.To Iwata, the 3DS is a means to bring 3D from being 'about impact', to being 'about depth', to be a serious part of the gameplay and the experience, instead of a simple gimmick. The 3D slider on the 3DS was created by request of Miyamoto and his engineers to have all kinds of people be able to enjoy the 3D graphics without experiencing double vision of blurry images due to their unique spacing between eyes, which has been in problem with many 3D movies, where the 3D is already set to a pre-set certain focus.An illustration showing how the 3D screen works.Unlike other 3D equipment, the 3DS does not require the use of 3D glasses. This is due to its auto-stereostopic ( parallax barrier) screen, capable of showing two different viewpoints of the same image at the same time. The screen has twice the horizontal pixel density of any other screen, which allows one set of lines aimed at one eye, while the other set is aimed at the other. The 3DS renders a single frame twice, each a different viewpoint, interlaced between each other vertically. Because of this, each eye will see a different frame, and your brain puts both of the frames together as a 3D image.This results in the game actually running at half the frame rate that it's running internally; to make a 60 fps game on the 3DS, the developer would need to be able to make it run at 120 fps in 2D. However, this does not take up half the power of the console, which is just an urban myth. Several games support two different framerates: 60fps in 2D mode and 30fps in 3D mode while a select few manage to run at 60fps in 3D mode such as Mario Kart 7 and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. This shows the advanced power of the hardware, which is capable of rendering high end shaders, lighting, shadows, textures, fur, bump mapping, normal mapping, and other effects in real time with ease.Available on the 3DS eshop is a virtual console library which includes Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Gear, and NES games.The 3DS supports Miis, including a Mii Maker feature that allows the 3DS to take a picture of the user or someone in the vicinity such as a friend or family member to use as a guide for Mii creation.Other built in software includes:Nintendo 3DS Camera - similar to DSi Camera, but with more features - including the ability to take pictures in 3D using the dual camera lenses on the system's top shell. Also supports the scanning of QR codes.Nintendo 3DS Sound - Audio playback application similar to DSi Sound with support for mp3 and AAC types with .m4a, .mp4 and .3gp extensions.StreetPass Mii Plaza - A version of the Mii Plaza which shows the Miis of other 3DS users encountered in StreetPass Mode (See below) and allows for their use in small games like Find Mii (A small RPG) and a Puzzle GameFace Raiders - An Augmented Reality Game where photos of the user or friends are placed onto balloons which fly around the environment as the player attempts to shoot themAR Games - An app which interacts with the bundled AR Games cards to provide access to various Augmented Reality functions such as placing 3D models of characters such as Mario in the environment or playing a number of advanced AR GamesActivity Log - Functions similarly to the feature seen on the Wii's Message Board, but is more advanced. In addition to game playing time, also tracks steps with the built-in pedometer (And therefore allows players to earn Coins, a system-level pervasive currency which can be used to unlock content in games) amongst other thingsGame Notes - By pressing the Home Button, the player can pause the game and use this system app to write things down using the touchscreen.Notifications - Notifies users of things like StreetPass Data having been shared or new SpotPass data being downloadedDownload Play - Allows players to partake in single-card Multiplayer Games from those games which support this feature (Such as Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition)Friends List - While it still uses a variation of the heavily criticized friend code system, players only need to register one single friend code which works on a system wide level instead of codes for every single title like on older systems, making the process far easier than before. It is also possible to directly join a friend's multiplayer session via the \"join game\" button in the friend list.Web Browser - A web browser that can run while a game is suspended in the background, letting players browse the web for tips, etc if they're stuck in a game.Miiverse - Nintendo's social \"empathy\" network made its way onto the 3DS via a firmware update in December 2013. It lets the 3DS access the service's features for games with communities on Miiverse and post drawings, text and (if supported) screenshots from the game. However, the 3DS version of Miiverse does not support messaging between friends.StreetPass is a functionality built in to the 3DS. If multiple 3DS systems which are powered on or in sleep mode were to come within a certain range of one another, they share data. This data includes the Mii data built-in to the system as part of the 'StreetPass Mii Plaza', allowing them to trade puzzle pieces or fight in the RPG mini-game 'Find Mii'. The feature is also supported by games. Users can choose to opt-in to StreetPass functionality for individual games. A bit of saved data then appears system-level to share it (so you don't need to be in sleep mode within the chosen software). A 3DS system is able to have up to 12 Apps/Games having StreetPass enabled at a time.SpotPass is the ability for the 3DS to seek Wi-Fi signals and automatically download content while in sleep mode. This allows games and the system itself to download updates and share data such as leader-board scores in a whisper-net like manner, free from user input.Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3DNintendogs + CatsProfessor Layton and the Mask of MiraclePuzzle Bobble 3DRidge Racer 3DSamurai Warriors ChronicleSuper Street Fighter IV 3DWinning Eleven 3D SoccerAsphalt 3DBust-a-Move UniverseCombat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3DLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone WarsMadden NFL FootballNintendogs + CatsPilotwings ResortPro Evolution Soccer 2011 3DRayman 3DRidge Racer 3DSamurai Warriors: ChroniclesThe Sims 3Steel DiverSuper Monkey Ball 3DSuper Street Fighter IV 3DTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow WarsAsphalt 3DLEGO Star Wars III: The Clone WarsNintendogs + CatsPilotwings ResortPro Evolution Soccer 2011 3DRayman 3DRidge Racer 3DSamurai Warriors: ChroniclesThe Sims 3Super Monkey Ball 3DSuper Street Fighter IV 3DTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow WarsTom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3DOn May 11th, 2012, Nintendo Japan announced that Aqua Blue would be ending production in that territory.On September 13, 2013, Nintendo Japan announced that the Cosmo Black launch model and the Ice White model are also being discontinued. These were the last models to ship with 2GB SD Cards. They are being replaced by Clear Black and Pure White models in October 2013.In April 2012, Nintendo gave 5,000 modified 3DS consoles to the Louvre in Paris. The 3DSs served as a replacement of the museum's previous audio guides that had become outdated. The 3DS serves both as a map and an audio tour. It contains over 35 hours of dialog in several different languages explaining the different works of art in the museum. It has since been released as a fully featured product on the eShop and was even made available in physical retail format exclusively at the Louvre's gift shop.The Louvre’s managing director Hervé Barbaret had this to say about the use of the 3DS at the LouvreThrough this partnership, we wanted to bring together heritage and the innovative world of interactive entertainment through a system many people are already familiar with. We feel that the Nintendo 3DS is perfect to achieve this goal... we believe that the new audio guide is a valuable tool that will help visiting the Louvre a more dynamic and rewarding experience, particularly for those that are not so familiar with a museum environment.",

    "description": "The iPad is Apple's foray into a new consumer electronics territory called tablet computing. The device uses a 9.7\" multi-touch screen and runs Apple's iOS mobile operating system, based on OS X. Similar to the iPhone and iPod Touch, the iPad features minimal use of physical buttons, providing only for Power, the Home screen, volume control, and an orientation lock which prevents the tablet's display from rotating with the user's movement, which can be configured to mute the iPad instead. It gained many good reviews from critics when it launched on April 3rd 2010, and sold 3 million units in 80 days.The iPad has two models on that runs on wifi and the other has a 3G network. The 3G version has a $130 premium. The launch prices are as follows.All six configurations and even their prices have remained the same for iPad 2 and iPad 3 launches. However, alongside the launch of both newer-model iPads, the price of the previous iteration may receive a price cut until stock is cleared.Steve Jobs has said that there is room to lower pricing in the future if necessary. To date this has not happened. Instead, the iPad has received yearly model revisions to improve the value proposition, with things like upgraded specs, and added features such as cameras, tilt sensor, and retina display.iPhone/iPod Touch apps and games are compatible with the iPad, and can be run at original resolution or a full-screen \"double\" resolution. The iPad also features exclusive games, which can be run by the more powerful 1 GHz processor with the 256 MB of memory.One of the key features of the iPad is its iBooks support. iBooks are essentially .pub formatted documents which is presented similarly to how a normal book would look. iBooks can be purchased from the iBooks Store and will be available to iPhone users as well later in the year with iPhone OS 4.0.Although the iPad 3G adds a $130 premium, the deal Apple struck with AT&T for the iPad's 3G plan is a pay as you go plan with no contract and no added fees. You purchase time through itunes, using the credit card that you have on file with Apple, or a unique one for AT&T. Prices start at $14.99 a month for limited access and $29.99 a month for unlimited access (both include free use at AT&T hotspots). Some of the features in the plan include no billing, no checks, no pay by phone surcharges, no added set up fees, and cancel at any time.Verizon has a tiered data plan. The cheapest is $20 a month for 1 GB, and the most expensive plan is $80 a month for 10 GB.Game Center is an unified log-in for iPad games which allows match-making, friends lists, achievements, leader-boards, and online play. Game Center has been compared to Microsoft's Xbox LIVE service.The second generation iPad was released in March 2011. It features a thinner case, forward and back facing camera, and the Apple A5 core processor.The third generation iPad, released in March 2012, has the Apple A5X dual-core processor and was the first iPad with a ''retina display''. It has a higher resolution than HDTV's, with such a high pixel density that they cannot be seen with the naked eye.The fourth generation iPad was released in November 2012, breaking the annual cycle of the release of iPads for the first time. It saw the introduction of Lightning connectors on iPads, a HD front-facing camera and an Apple A6X processor.The iPad mini was Apple's first tablet smaller than 9.7\", measuring 7.9\" in diameter, and weighing significantly less. It was released in November 2012 alongside the iPad 4. It had the same specs as an iPad 2, with a smaller, non-retina screen and a HD front-facing camera.Apple products are manufactured by a Taiwanese manufacturing company named Foxconn which has a track record of employee suicides. At least 14 suicides are confirmed in 2010. Long working hours and racial discrimination are cited as potential contributing factors.There has also been evidence reported of illegal overtime and failure by Foxconn management to report accidents.

    "description": "The Zeebo was a games console designed for less well-developed markets, or those that were only properly emerging. Like the three main consoles of its generation (the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360), the Zeebo possessed online capabilities, except over 3G networks.The concept of the Zeebo was first conceived of by Zeebo Inc. in late 2008 as a cheap and cheerful games console that could be released in developing nations. Since many consoles had absurdly high prices in some of these countries due to taxation laws, the Zeebo had a chance to break into the market as a cheaper option.The console was initially released in limited quantities in Rio de Janeiro on June 1st 2009 for R$499. By the end of the year, the price had dropped to R$299 and distribution had increased to cover the rest of Brazil. A Mexican version was released in November 2009 for MXN$2,499, and an Indian version in 2010.While they also intended on stretching out to China by the end of 2011, it's unclear as to whether or not this actually came to pass - On May 27, 2011, Zeebo announced that its operations and online service in Mexico and Brazil would end on September 30 of that year. Zeebo Inc. went on to announce plans to develop a \"next generation Android-based platform for launch in 2012\", before never being heard from again.The Zeebo console was designed and developed by Zeebo Inc., with the participation and aid of twelve different companies, primarily led by Tec Toy and Qualcomm. These companies were responsible for the production of the Zeebo in their own respective nations. (For example, Tec Toy built and handled the Brazilian version of the system). Qualcomm were also responsible for the system's BREW chipset, similar to that of some mobile phones of the time.The Zeebo used a mobile connection (3G or EDGE) to remain always connected to the internet, and downloaded games from an online store similar to that of XBox Live Arcade or PSN, using a \"zCredits\" system similar to Microsoft Points. This connection was free and had no subscription component. The online store was the only way to attain games, as there was no optical drive, so as to reduce both production costs and piracy - a serious issue for game developers in developing markets.In March 2010, Zeebo Inc. announced a partnership with AT&T that the press release claimed \"gives users access to AT&T's international roaming network, allowing users to carry out rapid trials of the Zeebo platform in new geographic areas as we establish longer-term agreements with local carriers for deployment of the system. It will also give us a chance to explore opportunities in the US market in the future.\" While this opened the door to a possible expansion into the US, this appears to have been canned shortly afterwards due to Tec Toy dropping the platform in favor of educational toys and software.A total of 46 games were released for the Zeebo. A lot of early releases consisted of ports of BREW-based mobile games like Resident Evil 4, FIFA 09, and even Quake. Over time, more localized content started to filter out, like the Zeebo F.C., Zeebo Extreme and Zeebo Sports range of sports titles. In 2010, a series of classic Data East games like Joe & Mac and Super Burger Time were ported to the platform.The Brazilian models of the Zeebo console contain three games pre-installed to the hard drive:Brain ChallengeNeed for Speed Carbon: Own the CityFIFA 09Meanwhile, the Mexican version of the console came with five different free games:Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3DPac-ManiaTekken 2ZenoniaZeebo Family PackThe Zeebo featured multiple types of controller:The Boomerang Controller.The Z-Pad is the standard controller for the Zeebo, and is shaped and styled in a manner similar to that of the Nintendo Wii's Classic Controller. The Z-Pad comes in the box alongside the controller, though you will need additional controllers in order to play multiplayer.The Boomerang controller is sold only by Tec Toy, with the Brazilian Zeebo. The controller contains an accelerometer. This allows games to be played with different movements and gestures, similar to the motion sensors of the Wiimote.A typical keyboard, used for web browsing, e-mail and social networking.ARM11 / QDSP-5 running at 528 MhzATI Imageon (renamed to Adreno by Qualcomm after buying ATIs Imageon Designteam & Chipdesign)1 GB eNAND Flash128 MB NAND Flash in MCP160 MB RAM, 128 MB DDR SDRAM in MCP + 32 MB stacked DDR SDRAM in MSM7201AVGA (640×480) – 4:3 aspect ratio3G (scaling back to 2.5G or 2G where necessary)3 USB ports 2.0 Standard A (for accessories)SD Card Slot / InterfaceInterface: USB HIDPower: AC adapter 5V 3AConsumption: 15 W max.Graphics: 4 million triangles / secondAudio: 8 channels simultaneous MP3, ADPCM, MIDIResolution: 640×480Size: W × D × H – 157 × 215.4 × 44 mmWeight: 1.3 kg (3 lb)Sensitivity: <- 106 dBm (in UMTS)",

    "description": "Android is an operating system designed by Google and that can be found on multiple devices. The OS is found on a variety of devices from a variety of manufacturers in various form factors. It is most commonly seen on smartphones and tablets.Matias Duarte, an Ex Danger software designer (Sidekick phone makers) and Palm phone software designer, joined Google's Android design team in 2010. With his lead, the team has implemented its unique Android design language and a theme called Holo, with a focus on clean, line based design, and a signature 'holo' blue accent color.In May of 2012, the android team declared a 'war on lag', and introduced the hardware accelerated feature dubbed 'Project Butter', aiming to be much faster than the previous Android 4.0. In update 4.2, Google introduced lockscreen widgets. Allowing users to pin a specific widget to the lock screen, that can be swiped away for more widgets, pressing on a prompt within the lockscreen would unlock the device and automatically go to the same app of the specific widget.Android is an open source OS based on Linux and ARM architecture. The Android was designed with Google specific applications in mind. It usually runs any application or service that associated with Google (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Talk, Google Translate, YouTube, etc.). It also possesses functionality for GPS and accelerometers. The latest version available is 4.4 (KitKat). Future versions will retain the confectionery/dessert naming motif.The home screen is extremely customizable. The OS comes originally with 5 screens. Much like Apple's iOS, users can put different applications and shortcuts on this screen, however the Android gives more options for customization. Above and beyond this, the open OS allows for third party developers to release their own home homescreen launchers to suit the needs of the individual. Popular home screen replacements include Go Launcher, LauncherPro, and Nova Launcher.Applications and shortcuts can be placed anywhere on the home screen. These widgets allow users to browse an app without actually opening it. For example, users can browse status upgrades on Facebook or go directly into Google Search from the home screen. Android also supports moving backgrounds, known as live wallpapers, that can either respond to touch, time of day, or move to music.Launched in October of 2008 as Android Market, Google Play is Google's distribution channel for apps, books, music and movies. The store features over 500,000 apps and games. Apps can be found by browsing categories or searching. Within each category there are multiple screens listing the most popular free and paid apps, popular new apps, and currently trending apps. Some categories have contain further categories that can be browsed.To distribute apps on the Google Play Store developers must register for the Google Play developer and pay a one-time fee of US$25. Developers make 70% of a profit from the app, while the last 30% go to Google. The is not a strict approval process. Once a new or updated app passes an automatic malware detection process, it will go live after a few hours. Applications which violate Google Play policies are reported to Google by the Play Store's users and.Unlike the App Store on iOS, it is not required to distribute through the Play Store. Developers may elect to distribute though other stores such as the Amazon Appstore, or handle distribution themselves. However, app stores themselves may not be distributed via the Play Store per the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement's non-compete clause.On March 6, 2012, Google re-branded the Android Market to \"Play Store\" as per their shift of focus to include all of their download services into one concept, Google Play.Google releases Android's source code through the Android Open Source Project, where it is then available for use by device manufacturers and hobbyists to create their own versions. In order for a derivative of Android to be allowed to call itself Android, it must comply with the Compatibility Definition Document. The CDD details the many things that must not be changed and what is permitted to be changed to meet compatibility requirements. Among other things, compatible devices must be able to correctly run the game Replica Island. Devices that do not meet these requirements cannot be marketed as Android and will not be distributed with the suite of Google applications. AOSP-derived products that have chosen not to meet Android's compatibility requirements include the Kindle Fire and the Ouya.The source code for Honeycomb (3.x) was not released to AOSP until the release of the Ice Cream Sandwich code.",

    "description": "Former Windows Phone logoWindows Phone is Microsoft's newest mobile OS. Unlike previous releases of this OS, that have been aimed more at a business market, Windows Phone is geared toward the consumer audience (instead of just the business world). With this new OS came a new UI. Microsoft's 'Metro' user Interface integrates many other Microsoft services like Xbox Live and Zune as well as popular social network sites.When it comes to multimedia Windows Phone 7 has two hubs, Music/Video and Pictures. From the 'Pictures' hub, you can view Facebook and Windows Live photo albums. You can also upload photos to popular social network sites. Interesting thing about this Pictures hub is that you can view and comment photos from Facebook without actually leaving that hub, so there is no loading separate Facebook app or a page in the web browser required.A typical Windows Phone 7 Start ScreenWindows Phone has a specific user interface that goes by the name of Metro that is similar to Zune HD's interface. Metro has a very minimalist design, focusing on big clear menus that are easy to select thanks to the phone's touch interface.Metro is also customizable. Most of the customization can be done on the main screen. You can select anything from the phone, be it an application, website, a picture album or even a contact and put it on the home page. Whatever you have selected materializes as a big square or rectangle, called a Tile. Tiles can be moved around to suit your preference and some Tiles are connected to the internet, which are know as Live Tiles, and can receive real time updates.A typical Windows Phone 8 Start ScreenSpecific functionalities are separated into different hubs, which are accessible through the home screen. There are six different Hubs: Music + Video, People, Photos, Games, Microsoft Office and the Marketplace.Microsoft introduced its new start screen on June 20th, 2012 at the Windows Phone summit. The new interface allows the user to adjust the live tiles to small, medium, or large (double wide) views. Windows Phone 8 brings more accent colors.The Music + Video part of Windows Phone is Xbox music. Here you can listen to music, podcasts and watch videos, including movies. Your music collection is wirelessly synchronized from your PC and you can download new songs from the marketplace as well as stream digital radio off the internet. You can also listen to FM radio. The radio works only with headphones due to using the wire as the antenna. WP is also compatible with the Xbox music Pass.To access Music Video you must select it from the home screen. You will arrive at the Xbox music menu where you will have the following choices: Music, Videos, Podcasts, Radio and Marketplace. After selecting any of these (a white arrow shows up next to whatever you have selected) you can scroll from left to right using your finger. The first screen that will show up is what your listening to, the second is your music library where you can also scroll up and down and the third screen is the Marketplace that shows you things that are relevant to what you have been listening to. You can also share your music with your friends and use KidsSafe Tunes, an app that keeps explicit music away from young children. You can control the volume by pressing the volume buttons on the side of the phone.People HubThe People hub is comprised of your phone contacts, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn friends, and contacts from your Windows Live Account. Each contact has a profile picture which is usually pulled from their Facebook profile picture. By selecting the Hub, your recent contacts appear. Slide your finger to the left and you can browse your entire contact list. You can quickly find contacts by hitting the letter beside his or her name (for example, the letter A) and the entire alphabet shows up and selecting a letter will bring you to all the contacts on your list that start with that letter. You can also sync contacts from a Gmail account.In your contacts there is the Me section, that groups all your personal information. It groups your Facebook and Windows Messenger info. It's also where you can find your own number and can be accessed from your contacts page.Pictures HubPhotos can be taken and stored on the phone in the Picture hub. You can view these photos in the hub in different ways. You can view them by most recent or you can sort them by date or by place, you can tag people and add pictures directly to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You can also check your friend's pictures, view Facebook and Twitter, and caption your photos.Former Games Hub InterfaceXbox LIVE is incorporated into the Windows Phone OS, aiming to bring an Xbox 360-like gaming experience to a mobile platform. Games that support XBOX Live can make use of Xbox LIVE achievements, avatars, leaderboards, etc. The game hub has 4 different screens. The first is My Collection where you can view and easily select any of your games. The second is a What's New screen showing you all the hottest releases. The third screen is your Xbox Live profile where you can view your avatar, your friends list and your achievements. The final fourth screen is your Xbox Live inbox where you can accept invites.As of 2/1/2012 there are 100 Xbox live game titles, with a new game added every week.Office HubWP7 has a Microsoft Office hub. Office Mobile is meant to be an extension of the user's workplace. In this hub, you can find mobile versions of Word, Excel and Power Point. OneNote Mobile lets you edit and save your personal notes by adding pictures and recordings. SharePoint Workspace Mobile lets you share documents with colleagues while on the go.Marketplace HubThis final hub lets you download content directly onto your phone. You can download music, movies and apps. Apps can be free or cost a certain sum but there are usually demos for the paid apps. The Marketplace can be accessed from both your phone and the Zune PC software. Purchases can be paid for through your credit card or the cost added to your monthly phone fee. Apps are developed using Silverlight while games are developed with XNA. Both operate under .NET Compact Framework. Before being launched in the Marketplace, apps must be certified by Microsoft. As of December 2011, the marketplace has over 50,000 apps available for download.WP7 is equipped with Internet Explorer Mobile 9. It uses the same core browsing engine as IE9 for the desktop. You can open multiple tabs and add websites to your favorites and even pin websites to the start screen. At launch, WP is not compatible with Adobe Flash Player but it has been announced they are working on it.",

    "description": "The Acorn Archimedes found success in the British education sector as it is the successor to the BBC Micro. The first models released were the A300 and A400 series. These featured an ARM processor, 512KB - 4MB of memory and 8-bit stereo sound. The machines were also capable of emulating BBC Basic and utilised a 3-button mouse as standard. Future models, such as the popular A3000, used the 8MHz ARM2 processor and then later the ARM3 at 25MHz. The operating system, RISC OS (Reduced Instruction Set Computing Operating System), was stored in ROM which contributed to it's fast speed and other features such as true multi-tasking, context-sensitive menus and anti-aliasing.However, while the Archimedes range were more powerful than the currently available personal computers, they failed to garner much popularity outside of the UK, Ireland and Australasia.Despite a small market outside of education, there Acorn Archimedes boasts a solid video game library. Many games of the decade saw releases alongside the Amiga and PC such as Magic Pockets and Lemmings. Aside from the multi-platform releases, the Acorn Archimedes was far from devoid of exclusive games. Starfighter 3000 is an example of a title that originated on the Archimedes and then saw later releases on the 3DO and even the Playstation.The Acorn Archimedes lost popularity in schools in the 90s as other platforms such as Mac and PC improved their multimedia capabilities and programs such as \"Computers for Schools\" that were originally partnered with Acorn shifted away. The Acorn RiscPC computers eventually replaced the Archimedes range, offering a dramatic increase in power, more expansion, dual processor slots. While Acorn Computers Ltd split operations in 1998 and ceased trading in 2000, the operating system RISC OS perpetuates through releases of different variants from RISC OS Select, Adjust and 6. These current releases operate on the RiscPC generation and on modern hardware via a commercial emulator.Four models were initially released in 1987, followed by a number of variations with minor changes.",

At launch, the eShop featured the following:DSiWare titles are available to download on the eShop. DSiWare games are stored in the system's internal memory instead of the SD card. They can be moved to the SD card, but must be moved back to system memory before they can be played.DSi games can be transferred over to the the 3DS via DS Download Play. Once the process is complete the games are removed from the DSi and the process cannot be reversed. Not all DSiWare is available on the eShop. Titles cannot be transferred until they are listed on the eShop.Referred to as \"Nintendo 3DS Downloads\" in the Nintendo eShop. New, original 3DS games are available to download, such as Let's Golf 3D and Dillon's Rolling Western. The prices of these titles currently range from $5.99 - $8.99The Nintendo 3DS features its own Virtual Console. Users are able to download old games from the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and NES. Prices for these titles range from $2.99 to $3.99 for original Game Boy games and $5.99 for Game Boy Color games. On February 22nd 2012, Nintendo announced that Game Gear and TurboGrafx-16 titles will be available on the eShop starting March. On September 12 2012, Nintendo of Australia's website updated with a GBA Virtual Console section before an official announcement had been made in that regard.None of these games are displayed in 3D.At GDC 2011, Nintendo has announced that they're going to remake classic Nintendo games to be displayed in 3D. The first game to be remade was Excitebike, which was free for all 3DS users until July 31, after which it cost $5.99.Other games that have been converted to 3D include Xevious, TwinBee, Kirby's Adventure, and Urban Champion, with prices ranging from $4.99 to $6.99.The Nintendo eShop features special hubs for retail games as well as original software, 3DS Virtual Console games, 3D Classics, and videos. Similar to the Nintendo Channel on the Wii, game publishers can promote their games by releasing demos, showing trailers and images, and even allowing users to review their products.Starting summer of 2011, the Nintendo 3DS will get its own Netflix app, with which Netflix subscribers can stream 3D movies from the internet to the 3DS. Nintendo has also stated that users can suspend playback on the 3DS and continue watching it on a TV using the Wii console.In October 2011, Nintendo revealed that Hulu Plus would be coming to Wii and 3DS by the end of the year.Due to lackluster 3DS sales, Nintendo lowered the price of the 3DS to $169.99 in the United States, 15,000 Yen in Japan, and the European prices were cut by a third. To compensate for early adopters, Nintendo created the Ambassador program. By connecting to the eShop by August 12, 3DS owners were eligible to receive 20 free games on the Nintendo eShop, 10 NES games and 10 Game Boy Advance games. Nintendo initially stated to have no plans to release the Game Boy Avance games for sale.These games do not have added 3D capability and the NES versions were incomplete when released on September 1st with updates to arrive at later points (coinciding with the respective game's official eShop debut). Ambassadors are able to download updated versions of the NES games at no extra charge.

    "description": "The Nintendo Wii U is the company's sixth home console since the original Nintendo Entertainment System and follows the hugely successful Wii. In keeping with their design philosophy, the Wii U is not a system focused on high-end horsepower but instead a new take on gaming interfaces and online integration with efficiently designed hardware.Asymmetric GameplayIts core hooks are the integrated second screen in the Wii U GamePad and their online social hub called Miiverse. The former introduces a focus on asymmetric gameplay in local multiplayer games which means the different players doing very different things in a game depending on which controller they use as well as more involved experiences and interactions in single player games with added functionality not previously possible. The latter is supposed to function as a seamless online community that makes it easier to discover what games people are actually playing and offers simpler ways to share stuff from within games and to communicate with other players around the globe.The system's backwards compatibility with Wii peripherals also ensures a wide variety of gameplay possibilities for all kinds of games.E3 2011 Media PresentationWith rumors hitting the week prior, Nintendo announced its next console on April 25, 2011. The news was issued via a terse update on Nintendo of Japan's investor site, stating that the Nintendo Wii's successor would be launched in 2012.On June 7, 2011 at their E3 press conference, Nintendo unveiled what they promised to be a new way to enjoy home entertainment with Nintendo's next home console, the Wii U. With a new touch screen controller that also includes all standard buttons, precision motion controls, and full 1080p HD graphics, Nintendo promises a whole new world of play styles and gaming possibilities for Wii U players. As Nintendo of America president and CEO Reggie Fils-Aime explained on stage that the Wii U is about tailoring the Nintendo game experience not just to a casual perspective, but for so-called hardcore players as well.In October 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they will be re-revealing the Wii U at E3 2012. Nintendo President Satoru Iwata mentioned during the company's Financial Briefing in January 2012 that the Wii U would launch during the 2012 holiday season.9/13/2012 Preview EventIwata announced during Nintendo's Financial Briefing in April, 2012 that all Wii U games would be available for purchase as traditional packaged software in retail stores and via digital distribution on from day one. Nintendo is partnering with retailers to allow the sale of digital codes through retailers to achieve a \"win-win\" situation. Additionally, he let it be known that, while the details and software line-up for Wii U would be announced at E3 2012, the actual launch date and price would be revealed at a later date.Nintendo revealed the final launch details for all territories on September 13, 2012. The Wii U launched in Japan on December 8, 2012 with 2 SKUs (Basic and Premium) but without pack-in software with the exception of Monster Hunter 3 HD Ver. bundle. In western territories, the Wii U also launched in both the Basic and Premium/Deluxe versions but the latter came bundled with Nintendo Land.8GB internal flash storage (can be expanded with up to 32GB SD/SDHC cards or up to 3TB external USB hard drives)Wii U GamePad (White)Wii U GamePad Stylus (White)Wii U Console AC AdapterWii U GamePad AC AdapterHDMI cablePrice: ¥26,25032GB internal flash storage (can be expanded with up to 32GB SD/SDHC cards or up to 3TB external USB hard drives)Wii U GamePad (Black)Wii U GamePad Stylus (Black)Wii U GamePad charging standWii U GamePad standWii U Console vertical standWii U Console AC AdapterWii U GamePad AC AdapterHDMI cableNintendo Network Premium: provides points for purchases by Premium Set customers, 10% points back on digital purchases depending on the title/publisher, to be redeemed once 500 points ($5) have been reached for future purchases.

As a transitional color, a yellow line is placed between the shape and the actual game artwork.This basic design mirrors that of the Nintendo GameCube cases which also featured a half-oval shape with a transitional line (in white) below it to separate it from the game artwork.As has been common practice in Japan since 2010 with games released on Nintendo platforms, the game cases for titles rated CERO: C and higher come in black cases. While on Wii and 3DS the platform banner is on black background, the Wii U logo banner features a gradient background that goes from black to the normal cyan color.Titles supporting any type of online functionality feature a Nintendo Network logo in the top right corner below the platform banner.Wii U ConsoleAccording to specifications released during E3 2012 by Nintendo, the Wii U is approximately 1.8 inches tall, 6.8 inches wide and 10.5 inches long while weighing about 3.41 pounds (1.5 kg).Media: A single self-loading media bay plays 12-centimeter proprietary high-density optical discs that can hold 25GB of data for the new console with a transfer speed of 22.5 MB/s. It also reads 12-centimeter Wii optical discs.Video Output: Supports 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p and 480i. Compatible cables include HDMI, Wii D-Terminal, Wii Component Video, Wii RGB, Wii S-Video Stereo AV and Wii AV.Audio Output: Uses AV Multi Out connector. Six-channel PCM linear output through HDMI.Storage: The console has internal flash memory, as well as the option to expand its memory using either an SD/SDHC memory card (up to 32GB) or an external USB hard disk drive (up to 2TB).CPU: IBM Power®-based multi-core microprocessor.GPU: AMD Radeon™-based High Definition GPU.Network: Wireless internet via IEEE 802.11b/g/n connection.RAM: 2GB of total RAM with 1GB for games and 1GB for system featuresPorts: Four USB 2.0 connector slots are included (two in the front, two in the back). The new console is backward compatible with Wii games and Wii accessories, including the Wii LAN adapter.Power consumption: The Wii U consumes up to 75W of power at most. Average usage comes in at around 45W.During the Pre-E3 2012 Nintendo Direct feature, Satoru Iwata revealed the official name for the Wii U controller. The name was inspired by the original NES controller which was the first controller to be referred to as a \"game pad\" by players due its flat design. Nintendo decided the name was also appropriate for the Wii U controller and thus they named it the Wii U GamePad as a call-back to the good ol' days.The Wii U GamePad features a touch screen along with button and stick inputs in line with with other controllers. This combination allows games to be augmented with real-time data displayed on the controller while the primary action occurs on the big-screen. The GamePad will function similar to the bottom screen on Nintendo's DS system, displaying information such as inventory systems or maps but also allowing for touch or stylus based gameplay input. The Wii U will allow using the GamePad screen as a primary display, so that other content can be viewed on the TV. There was some indication that this manner of screen swapping could even be taken a step further, giving split-screen players their own dedicated view, for example. The possibilities for so-called asymmetric multiplayer/co-op are a major part of the system's design.Wii U GamePad (2011 Prototype)The original prototype of the controller shown during E3 2011 incorporated two analog Circle Pads. These circle pads were not clickable and they were aligned vertically symmetrical directly above the D-Pad and face buttons on each side of the controller. The backside was flat except for a horizontal ridge that allowed the controller to be placed on flat surfaces at an angle and also housed the digital ZL/ZR triggers. The prototype neither featured the TV-button nor any NFC capabilities.Leak of the GamePad's revised design.In May 2012, a QA Tester for TT Games tweeted a picture of a revised Wii U Controller. This revision changed the Circle Pads to traditional, clickable Analog Sticks (with a circular gate instead of an octagonal one - a first for Nintendo) that are slightly offset from the Directional Pad and face buttons in addition to a host of other superficial changes, such as the appearance of the Wii U logo, rearranged Start and Select buttons, an unlabeled button that later turned out to be the TV-Control Button next to the power button, and the inclusion of the NFC reader/writer below the D-Pad.This leak cleared up speculation based on previously discovered patents showing these changes (and more) months earlier but was falsely believed to be an older design than the one shown at E3 2011. The patent also showed added grips to the bottom and a wider form factor.The controller includes a Power button, Home button, +Control Pad, A/B/X/Y buttons, digital L/R buttons and digital ZL/ZR buttons, two clickable analog sticks, a TV-Control Button and an NFC reader/writer. It also includes a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope and geomagnetic sensor, rumble support, a front-facing camera, microphone, stereo speakers, a sensor strip and a stylus. It also includes a 6.2-inch, 16:9 aspect ratio resistive LCD touch screen (does not support multi touch).The GamePad is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and weighs approximately 1.1 pounds (500 g). The battery life is given as lasting between 3-5h. By purchasing a separately available official High-Capacity Battery (2550mAh) (Product Code WUP-A-DLAA), battery life can be upgrade to an estimated 5-8h.During Nintendo's January 27th, 2012 Financial Briefing, they revealed that the controller would also support NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, ultimately allowing functionality similar to the figurine-scanning in Skylanders and enabling the scanning of Wii U eShop cards or credit cards for micropayments by placing an object or a card on the NFC Reader/Writer below the D-Pad. This would later be heavily utilized for Nintendo's figurine initiative called Amiibo.Watch TV on Wii U.Next to the Wii U GamePad's power button is the TV-Control Button. This button can be used even if the Wii U and TV are turned off. With the TV button, the Wii U GamePad turns into a \"fully independent infrared TV-remote\". Users can use the touch screen to switch channels, change the TV volume, view the TV Guide and turn on the Wii U system simply by using the touch screen on the GamePad.Nintendo president Satoru Iwata was quick to point out that the controller device was “not designed to be a portable video game machine, even though it shares some of the characteristics.” Killing the idea that the controller could be used as a legitimate portable gaming tablet (like Apple's iPad) which everybody was quick to compare it to. This becomes especially clear when one considers that none of the gameplay is rendered on the controller hardware itself.Wii U Pro ControllerThe Wii U Pro Controller is a secondary peripheral for use with the Wii U that functions as a standard console controller without the extra elements such as the touch screen display. It is primarily meant for use with multi-platform console games ported to the Wii U without GamePad-specific gameplay elements and for local multiplayer.The controller's shape resembles that of the standard Xbox 360 controller with button and stick placements mirroring that of the Wii U GamePad. It also includes rumble support and has a battery life of up to 80 hours. The Pro Controller is available in black or white everywhere except for Europe and Australia where the only Pro Controllers sold are black.Technically the Wii U supports usage two Wii U GamePads at the same time. It has been confirmed that using two GamePads simultaneously limits games to run at a framerate of no higher than 30fps due to the game outputting images to three screens at the same time. Initially it was said that launch-window titles would not make use of that functionality, however, since the system's market performance was behind Nintendo's expectations, implementation of support for two GamePads has been put on hold indefinitely.Up to four Wii U Pro Controllers can be used at the same time. The system will also support up to four Wii Remote (or Wii Remote Plus) controllers connected at once along with the Wii U GamePad (allowing for five players simultaneous multiplayer). The new console supports all first party Wii controllers and input devices, including the Nunchuk controller, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro and Wii Balance Board.At E3 2014, Nintendo revealed a special GameCube controller adapter that would allow original GameCube controllers (including Wavebirds) to be connected to the system via two USB connections. This adapter was specifically intended for use with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and launched alongside that title.The Wii U is fully backwards compatible with most Wii titles. However, it will not feature the GameCube backwards compatibility of the Wii. Wii title compatibility excludes software that required usage of the GameCube controller ports built into the original Wii models since these are also not available on the Wii U hardware.During E3 2012, Nintendo announced that it is possible for Wii users to transfer all their WiiWare and Virtual Console purchases to the Wii U, along with all the save data. This makes it the only 8th Generation console with full backwards compatibility covering both retail and digital libraries.To access all Wii-specific software, players have to access the Wii Mode from the Wii U main menu. This is a separate environment that disables all Wii U-specific features for optimal compatibility with the software.All transferred Wii data like save games, Wii Shop Channel purchases (Virtual Console, WiiWare) including leftover Wii Shop funds will be accessible via this mode. The Wii Shop Channel is not tied to the Wii U eShop and is thus completely walled off. Nintendo also announced a special upgrade program for Virtual Console software purchased on the original Wii and then transfered to Wii Mode (or bought directly in Wii Mode) which allows users to upgrade titles available on both Wii Virtual Console and Wii U Virtual Console for a fraction of the price to the Wii U VC version.In October 2013, a system update introduced the ability for Wii Mode to stream video to the GamePad meaning all titles in Wii Mode could be played in Off-TV Mode as well. However, since the Wii system does not recognize the wireless tech in the GamePad, games cannot be played with the actual Wii U GamePad or even Wii U Pro Controller and users have to stick with the original Wii controllers. Since the Wii U GamePad has a built-in sensor bar above the touch screen, players can utilize it to play even games using the IR pointer on the GamePad screen (or place a sensor bar elsewhere to increase comfort).During Nintendo's Financial Briefing on January 27th, 2012 Satoru Iwata announced the Nintendo Network platform. An overarching online platform that covers Nintendo 3DS as well as Wii U and future platforms, Nintendo Network supports various online services. Nintendo Network is an evolution from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection that was used in Wii and DS titles.Each Wii U console will allow for the creation of 12 unique user accounts. The console itself can go online by signing up for a Nintendo Network ID which manages eShop purchases, friend lists, Miiverse, online play and other functions.Unlike with the 3DS, the Wii U's eShop was made available at launch and offers a variety of download-only games as well as retail games for purchase.On November 14 2012, Satoru Iwata announced in a Nintendo Direct presentation that they are working on Wii U Virtual Console service that would have support for Off-TV Play with further details to be talked about later.On January 23 2013, Iwata confirmed that Virtual Console will be available starting in Spring of 2013. Confirmed consoles supported will be NES, Super NES, and Game Boy Advance. Any games that were previously purchased for Wii Virtual Console and transferred over will be deeply discounted for buyers of the Wii U version - down to $1.00 US for NES and $1.50 for SNES. Wii U Virtual Console games will feature additional features and are undergoing additional development beyond simple emulation. Starting that same day, a preview of the Virtual Console service to celebrate 30 years of Famicom was launched, showcasing a different game for 30 days at the price of 30 US cents.MiiverseOn June 3, 2012, Nintendo started its E3 presentations early by releasing a Nintendo Direct video detailing non-game aspects of Wii U before their official E3 Media Briefing on June 5. Aside from highlighting the changes made to the Wii U GamePad, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata presented a first look at Miiverse, Wii U's central hub for community/social features. Miiverse is essentially an evolution of the Mii Plaza and StreetPass Mii Plaza that first appeared on Wii and Nintendo 3DS respectively.Players enter the Miiverse upon booting up the system and are greeted by all the Miis tied to accounts on the system itself, Miis of their friends as well as Miis created by people either in the same region or speaking the same language in the Wara Wara Plaza (wara wara being a Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a bustling crowd makes).Actual handwriting!Miis are the main anchor for Wii U's social features. Messaging works like a Twitter feed that can be sorted by certain criteria. Users can filter messages pertaining to specific games, messages from people in their Mii Plaza, view their own activity log and other categories. Users can choose to either type the message using an on-screen keyboard on the touch screen or by going old-school with actual handwriting or doodling with their finger or stylus. The interface also allows the selection of emoticon-like expressions that will be represented on their Mii's face alongside the message.Since Miiverse is web-based, it was also made accessible via Nintendo 3DS, PC or any web-enabled mobile device later in 2013. To illustrate real-life use, the Nintendo Direct presentation showed a young man playing a Wii U game at home, suspending his game to post a Miiverse message asking for help with the game while his friend checked his own friend activity feed on his phone and called the former up to offer advice (and mockery).Users are able to post screenshots and transmit user generated game content via Miiverse communities. Miis in the Wara Wara Plaza and the Nintendo Land Plaza, for example, can also display speech bubbles representing posts their creators made to the related Miiverse community.Miiverse MessagingMiiverse is a feature native to the system that can be accessed at all times and by all games. This allows developers to integrate Miiverse directly into their games. Nintendo showed an example of this with New Super Mario Bros. U gameplay. Player-created messages pop up on the world map and at a certain point where Mario ended his life prematurely by, for example, running into a Koopa Troopa. This is reminiscent of a similar feature found in FROM Software's Souls series in which players who were connected to the internet with their console could leave messages at places of their choice, providing useful or misleading hints for other players to randomly stumble across.Iwata mentioned that while they are working to prevent people from spoiling moments in games with this feature, it was envisioned to increase empathy among gamers around the world. Because the Miiverse is integrated into the Wii U firmware, even strictly single player games with no dedicated online functionality can make use of this feature, potentially turning every game into a social experience with friends.Alongside Super Mario 3D World in November 2013, Nintendo introduced Miiverse Stamps. A Nintendo-take on achievements that ties in-game progress to unlocks of pre-made Miiverse drawings that players can use to create posts using official character art of a game. A user posting a stamp unlocked by a particularly hard unlock could thus be fairly easily recognized.Endless creeper cam possibilities.The built-in microphone and video camera in the Wii U GamePad allow for easy video chat among gamers. The basic idea was born in the N64 days when Genyo Takeda first expressed the desire to include a TV phone capability with Nintendo's home consoles.Wii U Chat displays the incoming video either on the GamePad or on the TV screen, depending on whether the user might be using it alone or wants to make a family call with more people around. If the Wii U is online and a call is coming in, the Home button on the GamePad will start to flash, informing players that there is a call waiting for them. If the system is not turned on, the caller can leave a message notification via Miiverse. In addition the video feed, users can actually draw on the touch screen over the image of video with a glowing line.Browse on both screensThe Wii U also launches with an Internet Browser that can be manipulated with the touch screen even while in-game. Videos can be displayed at full size on the TV while the GamePad is used for browsing while the video plays. It is also possible to prepare a video and conceal it behind curtains for audiences.Using the browser is possible without having to close a game that is being played to possibly search the internet for help or post 720p screenshots of the current gameplay scene to any image hosting services or social networks.Video playback formats H.264 and HTML5 are supported while Flash is not. Support for reading PDF files was later added via a system update.Watch TVii on your TV.At E3 2012, Nintendo announced that Wii U would also feature various video streaming services like Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and YouTube. In their Wii U preview event on September 13, 2012, Nintendo revealed more details about the service they are calling Nintendo TVii.This service, only available in North America, will give Wii U users access to all their video streaming services as well as their local network and cable TV programs in a central place.Various system updates introduced new functionality to the system. Among them an evolution of the WiiConnect24 concept of potentially receiving content at any hour of the day, even when the system was turned off. Wii U automatically checks for content while in standby mode (according to user preference) and can download and install software updates as well system updates in standby to make updating the system or games completely seamless.This also enables automatic content distribution, meaning users can opt-in to automatically receive available free software or demos in standby mode. Additionally, with the introduction of the Quick Start Menu that offers shortcuts of the most recent applications or games used upon turning on the GamePad, an optional messaging feature was made available. If enabled, users may receive notifications that display on the Wii U GamePad for a user-determined amount of time with information about all sorts of things like eShop promotions or upcoming events - all while the system itself remains in standby.",

The console sold well in Japan and Asia and then was launched in New Zealand, Australia, and France as well as other countries. The original SG-1000 was never released in the USA, but its other models were. Tsukuda originally released the Othello Multivision with its own brand games. Because the SG-1000s hardware was similar to the ColecoVision, Telegames created a clone known as the Telegames Personal Arcade in the U.S., which played ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000. The system was based on a clone of the ColecoVision known as the Dina 2-in-1. Also, Taiwan was one of the few countries to receive a platform known as the SG-1000 Mark IV. ",

Xbox Live will be compatible across the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, including support for cross-generation chat. Existing subscriptions will carry forward, and will be usable on both systems. An invitation to the Xbox Reveal.On April 24, 2013, Microsoft announced they would hold an event hosted by Don Mattrick on May 21, 2013 at their home office in Redmond, Washington to reveal the new generation of Xbox.Microsoft's Director of Programming for Xbox Live, Larry Hryb, commented that the Xbox Reveal event would focus on the hardware and features of the system, while most of the major game announcements would be presented at E3 2013, which is less than three weeks later. 8 Core CPU clocked at 1.75GHZ8GB Memory500GB HDDBlu-Ray Drive802.11n Wireless with Wi-Fi directHDMI In/OutUSB 3.0 The new controller is similar to the design of the Xbox 360 controller with some slight alterations. The controller features area specific rumble feedback at the triggers (one motor per side), in addition to the two \"normal\" rumble motors as used in the 360s controller.The D-pad has been changed to the cross designed as Nintendo's patent has expired in 2005.The two face buttons on the Xbox One (back and start on the Xbox 360) are functioned as view and menu.The Xbox One can come bundled with version 2 of the Kinect sensor. It features a 1080p camera, a time-of-flight depth camera, and an array of microphones. Originally, the Kinect had to be plugged in at all times for the console to function. It was later revealed by Marc Whitten that the system would work without the Kinect, but certain features are disabled (such as turning off your tv).The sensor motors have been removed and the field of view increased to detect users 3 feet away from the sensor. The increased tracking resolution allows the sensor to detect your heartbeat, facial expressions, fingers, weight on joints, and movement speed.On June 9, 2014, a cheaper Xbox One version was introduced, which does not include the Kinect.Heavily media based, the new Dashboard will include features such as Snap screen, existing voice commands and new gestures based on the Kinect. A \"trending\" feature will be in place to allow users to see the most popular content in use by other users, and to allow for more tailor made media and gaming consumption. Snap Screen allows users to view simultaneous and separate content without losing focus on the main task in hand, whether watching media or gaming. A Pin system was added to allow users to select games or apps to appear on the home dashboard for quick access.The Xbox One launched with the following titles:Assassin's Creed IV: Black FlagBattlefield 4Call of Duty: GhostsCrimson DragonDead Rising 3FIFA 14Fighter WithinForza Motorsport 5Just Dance 2014Killer InstinctLEGO Marvel Super HeroesLocoCycleMadden NFL 25NBA 2K14NBA LIVE 14Need for Speed: RivalsPowerstar GolfRyse: Son of RomeSkylanders: SWAP ForceZoo TycoonZumba Fitness: World Party",

    "description": "Sony PlayStation 4The PlayStation 4 is the fourth video game console produced by the Sony Corporation, and was released November 15th in North America and November 29th in Europe and Australia. It uses the x86 processor and 8GB of GDDR5 memory, making it much more PC-like (and easier to code for) than Sony's previous console, the PlayStation 3. It is capable of streaming games via Gaikai's streaming service, and features options such as gameplay video sharing, instant game resume from hibernation, a robust social network-like friends list, PS Vita integration & remote play, and background uploading and downloading. The new controller also gives players new input options via a touchpad and motion sensor light bar.For the first time on a Sony console, a paid membership to their PlayStation Plus program will be required to play online multiplayer on the PS4. Free-to-play & subscription-based games are however exempt, as are other online services such as Netflix. A single PS+ membership applies across the PS Vita, PS3, and PS4 consoles.During Sony's Gamescom 2014 briefing, the company announced that as of August 10th 2014 they had sold 10 million PS4 units to consumers. On March 3, 2015 Sony revealed the console had surpassed 20 million PS4 units sold to consumers.Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 on February 20, 2013 at a 2 hour event called PlayStation Meeting 2013, which was hosted by Andrew House & held at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.The hardware specifications and interface of the new console were presented by Mark Cerny, who also showed off the newly redesigned DualShock 4 controller.Gaikai CEO, David Perry, took the stage to talk about the potential their streaming and cloud gaming service can bring to the console.Various developers then took the stage to show a few of the games & concepts being developed for the platform, including DriveClub, Killzone: Shadow Fall, Watch_Dogs, The Witness, and inFamous: Second Son. The console itself was not revealed at this event. PlayStation 4 consoleThe public got its first look at the console on stage at Sony's press conference at E3 on June 10th, 2013, where it was revealed that it will cost $399 (US), contain a 500GB hard drive, and be packed with a controller and headset (ear bud + cord mic).On August 20th 2013 at Gamescom in Germany, Sony revealed the console would be released November 15th 2013 in the US and November 29th in Europe.The following games launched with the PS4:Angry Birds Star WarsAssassin's Creed IV: Black FlagBattlefield 4Blacklight: RetributionCall of Duty: GhostsContrastDC Universe OnlineEscape PlanFIFA 14flOwFlowerInjustice: Gods Among UsJust Dance 2014Killzone: Shadow FallKnackLEGO Marvel Super HeroesMadden NFL 25NBA 2K14NBA Live 14Need For Speed: RivalsPlayroomResogunSkylanders: Swap ForceSound ShapesSuper MotherloadSwitch Galaxy UltraTrine 2: The Complete StoryWarframeThe PlayStation 4 launched with the following digital entertainment apps in North America:Music UnlimitedVideo UnlimitedNetflixHuluAmazon Instant VideoCrackleCrunchyrollEPIXNBA Game TimeNHL GameCenterRedbox InstantVuduYuppTVMark Cerny reveals the DualShock 4 during the PlayStation Meeting 2013.The PlayStation 4 uses the DualShock 4 controller. It is similar to previous DualShock controllers at first glance, but it contains a few significant additions & alterations:Touch Pad - The center of the controller now features a touch pad in the center, capable of dual-touch input.Speaker & Headphone Jack - Below the touch pad is an external speaker for game sounds, and on the bottom of the controller is a headphone jack for headset communication.Light Bar - At the top of the controller is a color-changing light bar that is used in conjunction with the PlayStation 4 Eye to detect the movement & position of the player, very similar in function to the PlayStation Move controller.New Buttons - The hallmark \"Start\" & \"Select\" buttons that existed on every other PlayStation controller have been completely removed, with two new buttons flanking either side of the touch pad: Share button - To the left of the touch pad is the Share button, which allows players to upload gameplay screenshots & video with people on their friends list or on social media services.Options button - To the right of the touch pad is the Options button, which serves the function of the old Start button, for things like pausing the game and bringing up the in-game menus.Analog Sticks & Triggers Re-designed - The analog sticks are now concave, and the L2 & R2 buttons are more trigger-shaped, more similar to both the Dreamcast and Xbox 360 controllers.The DualShock 4 is available in Jet Black during the launch of PlayStation 4, and in Wave Blue and Magma Red on November 29th for Europe and before the end of 2013 for North AmericaSony is leveraging its $380 million acquisition of the cloud service Gaikai in the PlayStation 4. Gaikai CEO Dave Perry announced that the service will be fully integrated with the new system to provide background downloading of games, streaming of game content, and potentially providing backwards compatibility with the PS1, PS2 and PS3 libraries in the future. A major feature will be the ability to play instant demos on the new system, without the need to download files locally. Upon further clarification with Shuhei Yoshida, president of Worldwide Studios of Sony Computer Entertainment, not all games on the system will contain this feature, but Sony is \"highly recommending\" implementation. In addition, the Share functionality of the PS4 is tied to Gaikai, allowing for players on the system to share their gameplay to social networks such as Facebook and Ustream.Sony announced during their 2013 E3 press conference that the service would not be available at launch, but would be available sometime in 2014. The open beta for Playstation Now, the game streaming service powered by technology from Gaikai, began on July 31st 2014 in North America. It's only on the PS4 for now, but the company said it plans to later expand the service to other Sony gaming platforms.

    "description": "The Supervison featured many things similar to the first 1989 Game Boy models but was priced at a much lower cost of $49, lower or higher depending on sales and bundles. The included game was “CrystBall”, a clone of Breakout and the Game Boy’s Alleyway. In fact, many games were based on, or clones of, Game Boy or NES games.The Supervision was given away as a prize on Nickelodeon's Legends of the Hidden Temple game show, as well as The Price Is Right as part of Watara's failed marketing pushes.The Supervision featured an 8-bit 65C02 CPU that ran at 4mhz; the same CPU in the Atari Lynx and Turbografx 16/Turbo Express at a much lower clock speed. This made porting Game Boy and Game Gear games to the Supervision more difficult, since both the Game Boy and Game Gear ran a version of the Zilog Z80 CPU. This did not help the Supervision get the 3rd party support it lacked. The Supervision’s low power CPU was able to dynamically clock down to save power or totally stop, thereby making it even more power conservative than the Game Boy. However, both end up with the same battery life and voltage requirements. The Supervision can even use the Game Boy's AC adaptors with seemingly no bad effects.The Supervision's dot matrix LCD screen has an extreme amount of ghosting when fast moving games are played. Most are better off using a TV; like the new models of the PSP, it features a TV output for composite video. When it is plugged into the TV, a game can feature four colors or do full color NES-style games. The other link cable slot was a standard 2 player game link cable that connected two Supervisions together for 2 player gameplay.Costs were saved by the Supervision being much larger than the Game Boy, simplifying the manufacturing process. It came in many versions; the first was the large tilted screen model, which was later followed by a version with a more cross-like D-pad. Then came smaller brick versions shaped like the Game Boy and most other portable consoles at the time. Another version featured the same brick layout but had another version of the D-pad. These also had colors, a tilt screen system and white, yellow and red highlights. These are smallest of all the Supervisions and have dramatically different designs.CrystBallFatal CraftSuper KongChallenger TankKabi IslandJohn AdventureHero KidGrand PrixTennis Pro 92P-52 Sea BattleFinal CombatSpace FighterPolice BustGalactic CrusaderDreamworld",

    "description": "Linux is a Unix-like operating system created as a free software alternative to other Unix-like operating systems. The core component of any Linux-based operating system is the kernel, which was originally authored by Linus Torvalds and first released in 1991. Linux is typically distributed with user space applications developed from the GNU Project. Because of this, the Free Software Foundation, which created the GNU Project, prefers to refer to the operating system resulting from the combined kernel and applications as GNU/Linux.Linux is generally released in a distribution, such as Ubuntu, Gentoo, Debian, or Fedora (though a skilled user could theoretically build it from scratch). These distributions can be commercial, like Red Hat, or free like Ubuntu.Developer Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 due to dissatisfaction with the license restrictions of the MINIX operating system, which only allowed distribution for educational purposes. He initially developed the Linux kernel on MINIX and MINIX applications were used along with it. Development eventually moved to Linux with a GNU user space when the kernel had matured.Torvalds initially released Linux under a license that restricted commercial distribution, but in 1992, the license was switched to the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL is a free software license and does not contain the same restrictions as Torvalds' initial license choice. After switching the license to GPL, developers worked on porting the GNU Project applications to Linux, creating what is now commonly referred to as Linux or GNU/Linux.Linux has long been a popular choice for free and open source games like NetHack. Commercial games started appearing in 1994, when ID Software's Dave Taylor ported Doom to the platform. With the creation of Loki Software in 1998 porting became more common. Former Loki Software programmer Ryan C. Gordon continues to be involved in porting Linux games to this day.Windows compatibility layers such as Wine can be used to play games native to Windows on Linux, though it's not typically the best way to play those games. Wine can, however, run the Windows version of the Steam platform on Linux, which has a much greater library than the Linux version. The Wine website has a detailed database of games with information on how to run them in Wine.Indie developers generally support native Linux versions much more than larger publishers, with games like Minecraft being very successful on the platform.The Humble Bundle debuted in 2010, offering a selection of games to raise money for charity. Games are available for Windows, Mac and Linux, sometimes with games making their Linux debut as part of the bundle. Typical sales for the Linux version of the bundle rank it third, but the Linux users generally pay the highest average amount of money for the bundle(Contributors pay what they want).In 2013 the Steam digital distribution platform was officially released for Linux along with a variety of games. Although Valve only officially supports this version of Steam on Ubuntu, it can be installed on other distributions. Valve has also confirmed that their version of the \"Steam-box\" will run a version of Linux, though users will be able to install other OS's.On July 24, 2014, GOG.com officially started supporting Linux (four months after announcing their plans to add Linux support), inititally with a batch of 50 games, with another hundred to be made available in the following months. The games are made sure to work in the Ubuntu and Mint distributions and includes .deb installers for ease of use on those (and other Debian derivatives), but also include distro-independent tar.gz files.",

    "install_base": null,
    "description": "The Ouya (pronounced \"ooh ya\") is an android based video game console released in 2013. The idea of the console is that every console can essentially be used as a \"development console\" and thus developers have a much lower barrier to entry than on competing consoles.The Ouya, likely best-known for its meteoric rise in the Kickstarter space, initially shipped with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) as its base operating system. Developer consoles shipped in late 2012, and initial retail units began shipping to Kickstarter backers on March 28th, 2013.In early 2013, Ouya received backing from sellers such as Gamestop and Amazon.In January 2014, the Ouya team released a new version of the console with minor modifications to the original. For example, the internal storage is now increased to 16GB.Ouya distributes games through its own Ouya store. Though an Android device, it is not considered compatible with Google's Android ecosystem and owners will not be able to officially play games they've already downloaded from Android's Google Play app store. However, a recipient of one of the early consoles hinted that an Ouya owner could sideload app APK files onto the Ouya storage via USB connection to a PC, and then run those applications from a Settings & Management menu on the Ouya UI. (This activity was not actually shown in the user's YouTube video.)As of the initial shipping to backers, the lineup of upcoming software included Fez, Wizorb (which is currently available), Broken Age, and some other high-profile titles. (Much of what is available at the outset boasts titles from smaller developers including ports of existing mobile games such as Canabalt HD.) It was also reported that Ouya will support XBMC for streaming media.There are conflicting messages about the viability of rooting the Ouya. Rooting, similar to jailbreaking iOS devices, is a common practice among advanced owners of Android devices, and Ouya founder Julie Uhrman mentioned that the process would be simple in the effort to make Ouya as open as possible. However, some XDA community members have pointed to a July 2012 radio interview with Uhrman where she mentioned that rooted Ouyas would not be able to access the Ouya Store, making it difficult for players who both want to purchase Ouya games and have the benefit of a rooted system. There seems to be no up-to-date, definitive answer on how the retail unit responds to or supports rooting.The Ouya UI includes a \"Sandbox\" category, which is where games that aren't featured in the top tier of games (the \"Featured\", \"Genre\" and other categories on the UI's main screen) go. If you like a game in the sandbox, you can give it a \"Thumbs Up\", and if the title receives enough of these kudos, it may end up in the top tier for a wider audience to see.One of the more controversial decisions of the software distribution method was that all games were initially required to have a free component. This requirement was only vaguely defined by Ouya themselves and thus they're are several free to play games as well as games that offer a free demo before requiring players to purchase the rest. Some consumers complained that this made it hard to determine which games were which as upon release Ouya's main storefront did not list any price for any games with many gamers finding out that a title was only a demo after they started playing the game. From a developer standpoint, many noted that the lack of actual sales on the marketplace were relatively low when compared with platform's userbase. Ouya's controller mimics today's standard inputs, with two analog sticks, four face buttons, a d-pad, a Home button, twin shoulder buttons and twin triggers. It also includes a central touch panel, similar to what Sony later announced for the PlayStation 4 controller during its unveiling. It does not include a back button.The release of the console was somewhat controversial. The system began shipping to developers in late 2012. Because of the design of the console dictated that every console was a development console many press outlets began reviewing the console giving it unfavorable reviews, eventually Julie Uhrman stated that she though the reviews were unfair due to the differences from the eventual consumer model which led to questions as to why seemingly two tiers of the consoles were being release. Units for Kickstarter backers started shipping in the spring of 2013 with the console going on sale to the general public in early summer. However there were problems with some of the backer units particularly the controllers, furthermore many units did not reach backers in a timely manner with a few not reaching backers until after the retail release.",

It was a brief mention that the platform was currently in development, and that the system would be detailed further in 2016.Nintendo president Satoru Iwata previously mentioned that their future platform(s) would be able to \"absorb the Wii U architecture adequately\" while making clear that they are not going to be using the exact same architecture again. Iwata also stated that they are not aiming to create a console/handheld hybrid device but that there might be an increase in form factors for their hardware devices and that they would be \"like brothers in a family of systems.\"This will be the first Nintendo hardware developed with their formerly separate handheld and console hardware development teams integrated into one single team. Nintendo Network will be a core element of the new system(s) along with its new membership (replacing Club Nintendo) service developed also in partnership with DeNA.",

    "description": "Announced at Apple's September 2015 special event, the Fourth Generation of the Apple TV is a considerable upgrade from the previous versions of the device, which were smaller and solely focused on playing and streaming media files using Apple-authored apps.The new version of the system uses a subset of Apple's iOS mobile operating system known as tvOS, along with the A8 system-on-a-chip utilized in the iPhone 6S, and a new \"Siri Remote\" that includes a motion sensor, microphone and touch pad. As a result, Apple has released SDKs that allow for development of apps and games for the platform.",
