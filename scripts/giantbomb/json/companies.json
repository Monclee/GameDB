    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Electronic Arts is an American developer, publisher, marketer and distributor and is one of the largest video game companies in the world. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-18128\" href=\"/trip-hawkins/3040-18128/\">Trip Hawkins</a> founded the company in 1982 and was a pioneer in <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">the video game</a> industry. When originally formed, EA was a publishing house, but slowly began to develop in-house games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8819\" href=\"/skate-or-die/3030-8819/\">Skate or Die</a>. EA then began to purchase various developers, quickly becoming one of the largest publishers in the industry.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5028/1777475-electronic_arts.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777475\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 760px\" data-ratio=\"0.37894736842105\" data-width=\"760\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5028/1777475-electronic_arts.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777475\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5028/1777475-electronic_arts.png\"></a><figcaption>Electronic Arts original logo</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Trip Hawkins originally created the company as Amazin' Software. Hawkins quickly began filling the roster with former co-workers from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\" href=\"/apple-inc/3010-5815/\">Apple</a>. Hawkins had a <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">sales strategy</a> to sell directly to the buyers. This proved difficult because retailers were interested in well-known brands such as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"/atari-inc/3010-182/\">Atari</a>. However, Amazin' Software thrived, earning revenue of $11 million. Despite success, many of Amazin' Software's internal employees disliked the name of the company. After several meetings, they had a new name: Electronic Arts. The name change came with other changes and after 9 years as the CEO, Hawkins left Electronic Arts and formed <a data-ref-id=\"3010-224\" href=\"/the-3do-company/3010-224/\">3DO</a>.</p><p style=\"\">After Hawkins departure, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-21205\" href=\"/laurie-probst/3040-21205/\">Larry Probst</a> filled his position. Probst wanted EA to be lead with principle and integrity and refused to allow EA to publish any M-rated games, which had become more of a mainstay in the industry. This caused problems for EA and the company's stock fell significantly. Probst faced major criticism from the public and investors alike. Under mounting pressure, he eventually changed his stance on M-rated games. EA published its first M-rated game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8870\" href=\"/system-shock-2/3030-8870/\">System Shock 2</a>, in 1999. This change marked a new beginning for EA, historically signaling the company's rise to become one of the prominent and largest publishers in the industry.</p><p style=\"\">In 2004, EA purchased the exclusive license of ESPN and the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">NFL</a>. This was seen as one of the largest deals in video game history. Many gamers felt that the 2K series was of much higher quality than the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">Madden series</a> and it forced the series on any gamer wanting to play a NFL title. EA would then go on to acquire the exclusive license to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-485\" href=\"/ncaa-football/3025-485/\">NCAA football</a>, furthering expanding their foothold in football. EA capitalized on its licensing deals, instating yearly releases of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">Madden</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-609\" href=\"/fifa-soccer/3025-609/\">FIFA</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-590\" href=\"/nhl/3025-590/\">NHL</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-494\" href=\"/nba-live/3025-494/\">NBA Live</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-455\" href=\"/pga-tour-golf/3025-455/\">Tiger Woods PGA Tour</a>, and more.</p><p style=\"\">In 2007, Probst stepped down from his position as CEO and appointed <a data-ref-id=\"3040-65707\" href=\"/john-riccitiello/3040-65707/\">John Riccitiello</a> to CEO. Under Riccitiello, Electronic Arts would expand further than ever. Riccitiello went on to purchase major game developers, including <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2628\" href=\"/mythic-entertainment/3010-2628/\">Mythic Entertainment</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1779\" href=\"/pandemic-studios/3010-1779/\">Pandemic Studios</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-98\" href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\">BioWare</a>. Riccitiello also made a bid for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-450\" href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\">Take-Two</a>, EA's main competitor. The bid lead to very long series of delays and changes to the deal but was ultimately declined by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-450\" href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\">Take-Two</a>. Critics say it was a bad decision not to accept the deal, as nobody else would offer them a price even close to EA's. Gamers were very pleased with this, as some of their favorite franchises would not be \"lost\" to EA (such as <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\">GTA</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\" href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\">Bioshock</a>). If the deal had gone through, the acquisition would have been the largest deal in video game history.</p><p style=\"\">On July 31, 2008, Hall of Fame football player <a data-ref-id=\"3040-18531\" href=\"/jim-brown/3040-18531/\">Jim Brown</a> sued EA for \"unspecified damages for trademark infringement, unauthorized use of his likeness, trademark dilution and unfair business practices and competition.” Brown's claim was on the \"All-Browns\" team in Electronic Arts' <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">Madden</a> series the running back is African American player wearing the number 32. This player is obviously meant to be Jim Brown. Brown also demanded that his likeness be removed from the game.</p><h2>Criticism</h2><p style=\"\">Electronic Arts had historically been recognized as one of the most hated video game companies in the industry. Many gamers see EA as trying to form a monopoly by acquiring many game developers and publishers. Some also believe once EA acquires a developer, the quality of that studios titles drop due to EA trying to meddle with and milk the franchises owned by these companies. EA also receives criticism because of their yearly installations of their games. Many feel that these games are just very small changes between them and that they are rushed out each year.</p><p style=\"\">Starting in late 2007/early 2008 however, EA has earned new respect and recognition from gamers. While still developing and publishing their annual franchises, EA’s focus shifted towards new - and often innovative - IP's. Titles published and developed in 07/08 such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5228\" href=\"/skate/3030-5228/\">Skate</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21213\" href=\"/mirrors-edge/3030-21213/\">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20800\" href=\"/dead-space/3030-20800/\">Dead Space</a> have helped significantly increase EA's reputation among gamers. This, along with deliberately antagonistic comments from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6397\" href=\"/activision-blizzard-inc/3010-6397/\">Activision Blizzard</a> CEO <a data-ref-id=\"3040-14885\" href=\"/robert-kotick/3040-14885/\">Bobby Kotick</a>, has helped lend credence to the phrase \"Activision is the new EA.”</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, EA has lost many of its <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a> fans due to its installations of the anti-piracy software <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2720\" href=\"/securom/3015-2720/\">SecuROM</a>, though this has backfired, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14139\" href=\"/spore/3030-14139/\">Spore</a>, a game with plenty of controversy over this security software, became the #1 most pirated game of 2008. In 2012, the company was also awarded the title as the <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/2012/04/04/congratulations-ea-you-are-the-worst-company-in-america-for-2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Worst Company in America\"</a> by The Consumerist via an online voting ballot.</p><h2>Company Structure</h2><p style=\"\">EA's structure consists of four major division called Labels, with each studio owned by EA falling into one of the three Labels. EA Labels is headed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-11860\" href=\"/frank-gibeau/3040-11860/\">Frank Gibeau</a>. EA Labels consist of</p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\">EA Games</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\" href=\"/ea-sports/3010-6255/\">EA Sports</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3010-7697\" href=\"/ea-play/3010-7697/\">EA Play</a></li></ul><p style=\"\">EA has a sub-Label called <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7698\" href=\"/ea-interactive/3010-7698/\">EA Interactive</a> which consists of studios developing games for the Mobile and Social markets.</p>"

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><h3>History</h3><p style=\"\">Trinity Acquisition Corporation, founded in 1989, merged with Toy Headquarters in 1991 to form T.HQ. T.HQ, more commonly referred to without the punctuation, was added to the NASDAQ National Market in 1994. Toy Headquarters was founded in 1990 by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98126\" href=\"/jack-friedman/3040-98126/\"> Jack Friedman</a> with his own money. THQ boasted two early successes in video games, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12689\" href=\"/wheres-waldo/3030-12689/\"> Where’s Waldo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6595\" href=\"/home-alone/3030-6595/\"> Home Alone</a>, awful titles which succeeded due to the popularity of their source material. THQ acquired its first developer, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1605\" href=\"/black-pearl-software/3010-1605/\"> Black Pearl Software</a>, in 1992.</p><p style=\"\">Throughout the mid ‘90s the company fell into financial troubles losing millions of dollars. In 1995, Jack Friedman turned over the company to his CFO, Brian J. Farrell. The first thing Farrell did was fire half the staff, proving his own status as a heartless villain. Next, he increased the number of games the company developed, despite having half the people to work on them. The changes inexplicably worked and THQ’s profits recovered. In 1997, THQ released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14786\" href=\"/wcw-vs-nwo-world-tour/3030-14786/\"> WCW Vs nWo: World Tour</a> to great success. THQ continued to release licenced games with great success.</p><h3>Expansion of Non-Licensed Games</h3><p style=\"\">THQ continued to release a variety of licensed games, including <a data-ref-id=\"3025-130\" href=\"/wwe/3025-130/\"> WWE</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-337\" href=\"/spongebob-squarepants/3025-337/\"> Spongebob SquarePants</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-227\" href=\"/warhammer-40000/3025-227/\"> Warhammer 40,000</a> games. The studio also began release more non-licensed and critically-acclaimed titles including <a data-ref-id=\"3025-386\" href=\"/saints-row/3025-386/\"> Saints Row</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20991\" href=\"/darksiders/3030-20991/\"> Darksiders</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In late 2010 the company released the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32359\" href=\"/udraw-studio/3030-32359/\"> Udraw</a> tablet for the Wii game console. The accessory along with the games that supported it were a hit and so the company soon decided to release versions of the tablet for the Xbox 360 and PS3 which sold way below expectations. This led to the company experiencing economic troubles early on in 2012. Events were improved, as the game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25725\" href=\"/saints-row-the-third/3030-25725/\"> Saints Row the Third</a> became an unexpected hit for the company. In response to both of these events THQ made the decision to step away from childrens' games almost entirely and instead focus on games aimed towards core gamers.</p><h3>The uDraw Debacle</h3><p style=\"\">In 2011, THQ decided to release PS3 and Xbox 360 variants of the uDraw tablet, an accessory that had previously sold well for the company on the Wii. However, THQ grossly miscalculated the demand for such an accessory on the other platforms. With the vast majority of the expensive-to-produce tablets left unsold, the company's finances took a hit to the degree that steps were required to prevent falling into bankruptcy and being de-listed from NASDAQ. They cut several in-development projects from their slate, including <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31672\" href=\"/devils-third/3030-31672/\"> Devil's Third</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33399\" href=\"/insane/3030-33399/\"> inSANE</a>, and turned their focus to core franchise titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29941\" href=\"/darksiders-ii/3030-29941/\"> Darksiders II</a> and a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36884\" href=\"/the-next-great-sequel-in-the-saints-row-franchise-working-title/3030-36884/\"> fourth Saints Row entry</a>. THQ studio staff was also affected, with THQ San Diego notably being shut down during the week of E3 2012. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-19167\" href=\"/jason-rubin/3040-19167/\"> Jason Rubin</a> was also brought in to serve as the company's new chief executive.</p><h3>Bankruptcy and Dissolution</h3><p style=\"\">On December 19th, 2012, THQ filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy with intention to sell off the company's assets to venture capital firm Clearlake in order to allow the business to survive.

They first started developing <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> games and had several successful titles in the early 1980s, one example being <a href=\"/arabian/3030-22221/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22221\">Arabian</a>. Console development started around 1985 with games for the Famicom being the main focus. It had already gone international with their arcade games when the NES hit the US and Europe, so they didn't have much trouble securing major licenses like <a href=\"/batman-the-video-game/3030-21264/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21264\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"/festers-quest/3030-5374/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5374\">The Addams Family</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Like many other developers at the time, their first Famicom games were ports of their arcade games. The first Famicom game Sunsoft released was in fact <a href=\"/super-arabian/3030-7028/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7028\">Super Arabian</a>. Sunsoft did not enjoy a sterling reputation early on, with many of their games being quick cash-ins of popular Japanese licenses and mahjong games. It wasn't until the late 80s and early 90s that SunSoft's games really started to stand out against the competition.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/817057-1197424981_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817057\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.876\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/817057-1197424981_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817057\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/817057-1197424981_00.png\"></a><figcaption>Mr. Gimmick </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Sunsoft took existing ideas and perfected them. The hardware was pushed to its limits in a lot of their games to produce graphics and sound that were almost unheard of on the NES at the time, and the gameplay and controls were generally tight. This is probably the main reason many of their NES games are now considered classics of the era. Some examples include <a href=\"/blaster-master/3030-1257/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1257\">Blaster Master</a>, <a href=\"/journey-to-silius/3030-18435/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18435\">Journey to Silius</a>, <a href=\"/mr-gimmick/3030-6037/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6037\">Mr. Gimmick</a> and <a href=\"/ufouria-the-saga/3030-14239/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14239\">Ufouria: The Saga</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Sunsoft was also one of few companies aside from Nintendo themselves that actually corrected their games for the PAL market, so the sound and graphics in their games are reproduced correctly in the PAL region as well. Usually companies would just release the NTSC version in the PAL region, not bothering to optimize the games to 50hz, making the games run around 20% slower in the PAL region. It wasn't until the N64 that this became standardized.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/1088344-hebereke__j__200907222356210.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088344\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/1088344-hebereke__j__200907222356210.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088344\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/429/1088344-hebereke__j__200907222356210.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/429/1088344-hebereke__j__200907222356210.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ufouria: The Saga </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But when the company started focusing on developing for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a>, few of their games stood out as much as their NES games had done, so they didn't garner much interest among audiences.

Originally founded by former employees of Martin Marietta’s Advanced Simulation Group, n-Space is and always has been an independently organised developer, meaning that they do not recieve investments from third-parties, but work exclusively with publishers to earn money for projects.</p><p style=\"\">The founders, being ex-employees of an advanced simulation group, decided that one of their goals would be to make state of the art games using world class 3D military simulators due to their familiarty with 3D graphics technology that would not be in the hands of the public. Prior to n-Space's foundation, the founders also had experience with hardware as working for Martin Marietta, they were involved in the production of SEGA’s Model-2 &amp; Model-3 arcade hardware. n-Space's founders have also boasted of being trained by a legend in the industry, Yu Suzuki, in the art of game design during production of the game Desert Tank.</p><p style=\"\">Since their opening, n-Space has always remained in Orlando, Florida.</p><h2>Today</h2><p style=\"\">At present there are 130 employees at n-Space. The average employment period is 3 years and there are 23 employees who have been with the company for more than 5 years. There are only nine employees with more than 10 years experience at n-Space.

In 1999, the company became a subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a German publishing company that went public during the dot-com boom. Shortly after Piranha Bytes released their first game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1982\" href=\"/gothic/3030-1982/\">        Gothic</a>, in late 2001, Phenomedia went into insolvency proceedings after allegations that several executives had falsified balance sheets, for which several served prison sentences for securities fraud. In response, Piranha Bytes executed a management buyout to sever itself from Phenomedia, changing their name in Pluto 13.<br /><br /><h2>Split With JoWood </h2>In 2007, Piranha Bytes split with its long time publisher, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-54\" href=\"/jowood-productions-software-ag/3010-54/\">             JoWood Productions</a>. In the split, JoWood retained publishing rights to the company's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-672\" href=\"/gothic/3025-672/\">            Gothic </a>series, including future releases. This lead to Pluto's next title, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23081\" href=\"/risen/3030-23081/\">           Risen</a>, not being a game in the franchise, even though it highly resembles the Gothic series in using the same engine and storytelling mechanics, even to the point of being commonly referred to as Gothic 4."

Martin Bromely, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert started the company in Honolulu, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1298\" href=\"/hawaii/3035-1298/\" slug=\"hawaii\">Hawaii</a>. They created the company to make Coin-op games for US Military Servicemen, who had all this spare time on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1996\" href=\"/military-base/3035-1996/\" slug=\"military-base\">military bases</a>. Originally the company was named <b>Standard Games</b>, However that was quickly changed to <b>Service Games</b>, and in 1951 Bromely got the idea to move the company to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1341\" href=\"/tokyo/3035-1341/\" slug=\"tokyo\">Tokyo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-37\" href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" slug=\"japan\">Japan</a>. In May of 1952, a new business name was registered, \"Service Games of Japan\".</p><p style=\"\">Two years go by, it's 1954, and another American businessman, David Rosen, is starting up a company in Japan called Rosen Enterprises Inc. The Company was originally created for exporting art, but during Rosen's time in Japan, he noticed a popular phenomenon. People in Japan were really into coin-op instant photo booths! The company changed their ways and started importing and exporting various coin-op games.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/377038-458px_flyer_sega_periscope.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-377038\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3078602620087\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/377038-458px_flyer_sega_periscope.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-377038\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/377038-458px_flyer_sega_periscope.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A flyer for Sega's 1965 coin-op game, Periscope.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In 1965, Rosen Enterprises and Service Games merged together, Rosen's name was dropped completely, and Service Games shortened their name to only the first two letters, SE, and GA. The new corporation was named <b>Sega Enterprises</b>, and it was only the beginning for this soon-to-be-huge company. The first game released by Sega Enterprises was another coin-op game called <i>Periscope</i>. The game was a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-828\" href=\"/submarine/3055-828/\" slug=\"submarine\">submarine</a> simulator, and was an international hit.</p><p style=\"\">Gulf Western bought Sega Enterprises in 1969, but allowed Rosen to stay the CEO of the company. Rosen led the company to prosper even further, creating more and more coin-op games.</p><h2>Entry into the Video Game Market (1982-1986)</h2><p style=\"\">By 1982, Sega's revenues hit $214 million. The company was growing strong, with the advent of video <a data-ref-id=\"3045-84\" href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" slug=\"arcade\">arcades</a>, and growing demand for the home video game market, Sega released a few new products in Japan in 1983. The first was <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33776\" href=\"/subroc-3d/3030-33776/\" slug=\"subroc-3d\">Subroc-3D</a>, which was an arcade game that utilized two periscope-type devices to view 2D sprites on a 3D plane. Sega also released their first home video game console, the SG-1000, due to the growing home video game market. It Included some popular arcade titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099/\" slug=\"space-invaders\">Space Invaders</a>, and Sega's own, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9547\" href=\"/zaxxon/3030-9547/\" slug=\"zaxxon\">Zaxxon</a>. Another arcade title they released was Astron-Belt, one of the first games to use laserdisc media. This title would be licensed out to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-185\" href=\"/midway/3010-185/\" slug=\"midway\">Bally Midway</a> for release in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\" href=\"/north-america/3035-1664/\" slug=\"north-america\">North America</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/381452-zaxxon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381452\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/381452-zaxxon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381452\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/381452-zaxxon.png\"></a><figcaption>Zaxxon was a very popular arcade title.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In 1983, however, Sega was having financial troubles in the U.S., the American video game crash was apparent, and video games were seemingly fading away into obscurity. Gulf Western was pressured by the great crash, and sold all of Sega's U.S. assets off to a company called <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3045\" href=\"/bally-mfg-corp/3010-3045/\" slug=\"bally-mfg-corp\">Bally Manufaturing Corperation</a>, who specialized in making pinball games. All of this prevented the SG-1000, and it's second release from 1984 , the SG-1000 Mark II, from ever being released in the U.S. The Japanese assets of Sega were purchased by a group of investors that included <a data-ref-id=\"3040-37033\" href=\"/hayao-nakayama/3040-37033/\" slug=\"hayao-nakayama\">Hayao Nakayama</a>, who owned a distribution company acquired by Rosen back in 1979.

Thanks to the release of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">NES</a>, Video games were starting to resurface in the US, and Sega of America was officially established as a business name in 1986.</p><h2>Sega vs. Nintendo, The Epic Battle of Home Consoles (1987-1994)</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/381339-ms1v1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381339\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.67343976777939\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/381339-ms1v1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381339\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/381339-ms1v1.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/381339-ms1v1.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Sega Master System</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Now that Sega of America was developed, Sega was ready to bring its home game consoles to the US, however, the SG-1000 Mark I wasn't as technically powerful as the Mark III, so in 1986, they re-released the <b>SG-1000 Mark III</b> in the US under the name of the <b><a data-ref-id=\"3045-8\" href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" slug=\"sega-master-system\">Sega Master System</a></b>. The system had various titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9493\" href=\"/fantasy-zone/3030-9493/\" slug=\"fantasy-zone\">Fantasy Zone</a>, which created their first popular mascot, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5163\" href=\"/opa-opa/3005-5163/\" slug=\"opa-opa\">Opa-Opa</a>. A little later that year, Sega had developed a new mascot to replace Opa-Opa with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-42\" href=\"/alex-kidd/3005-42/\" slug=\"alex-kidd\">Alex Kidd</a>. It wasn't actually official if this was their new mascot or not, but due to the popularity of the game, everybody assumed it was. The North American market wasn't enthralled by Sega's console, due to low sales. The major problem was the aggressive advertising strategy <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> employed with their console. Even though the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-8\" href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" slug=\"sega-master-system\">Master System</a> was technically superior to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">NES</a>, Nintendo was still able to get the upper hand. They already had the Famicom out since 1983 in Japan and the NES since 1985 in the US, so they got the upper hand by having their system out first. The Master System did well in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-289\" href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" slug=\"europe\">Europe</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-720\" href=\"/brazil/3035-720/\" slug=\"brazil\">Brazil</a>, however.

The system had lots of great arcade titles from that time such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14351\" href=\"/golden-axe/3030-14351/\" slug=\"golden-axe\">Golden Axe</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2536\" href=\"/altered-beast/3030-2536/\" slug=\"altered-beast\">Altered Beast</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12381\" href=\"/ghouls-n-ghosts/3030-12381/\" slug=\"ghouls-n-ghosts\">Ghouls N' Ghosts</a> made the Mega Drive a great system to play great arcade titles of the time on. Other titles like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11133\" href=\"/earthworm-jim/3030-11133/\" slug=\"earthworm-jim\">Earthworm Jim</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9286\" href=\"/ecco-the-dolphin/3030-9286/\" slug=\"ecco-the-dolphin\">Ecco the Dolphin</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2190\" href=\"/gunstar-heroes/3030-2190/\" slug=\"gunstar-heroes\">Gunstar Heroes</a> came eventually and showed that the Mega Drive had a slew of great original content with that same arcade-like style that everybody enjoyed. However, no game spurred more commotion than the 1991 release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/\" slug=\"sonic-the-hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/380909-segagenesis1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380909\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.61551155115512\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/380909-segagenesis1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380909\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/380909-segagenesis1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/380909-segagenesis1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Sega Genesis, the US Region release.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-73\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" slug=\"sonic-the-hedgehog\">Sonic</a>, The little blue hedgehog made his mark on the Genesis, so much that people saw Sonic and Mario as direct competitors. Everybody who grew up around this time must have had some sort of argument in school with their friends at the lunch table. Who was better? Mario or Sonic? That's for everybody to decide on their own, but the two were very evenly matched at the time of the release of the Mega Drive.</p><p style=\"\">In 1991, Nintendo released the Super Famicom in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-37\" href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" slug=\"japan\">Japan</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" slug=\"snes\">Super NES</a> in North America (which came to be known as the SNES) as direct competition for the Genesis. It had technically superior software, and a bunch of popular Nintendo franchises being released for it. In 1992 Sega released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" slug=\"sonic-the-hedgehog-2\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, and fans went crazy over the game, Genesis was growing ever more popular, and Sonic 2 was, and still is, the highest selling Sega game ever made, selling 6 million copies as of June 2006. Also in 1992 Sega released the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-29\" href=\"/sega-cd/3045-29/\" slug=\"sega-cd\">Sega CD</a> (called Mega-CD in all other regions except North America). This was an add-on to the genesis which used CD media which was more powerful and cheaper to produce than the Cartridge. This was a great opportunity for Sega to get the edge on Nintendo. However, with a disappointing game library full of games which were only upgraded ports of previously released games on the Genesis and an obsessive focus on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-604\" href=\"/fmv-full-motion-video/3015-604/\" slug=\"fmv-full-motion-video\">FMV</a> games the Sega CD didn't live up to its full potential. By 1994, the Genesis had lost the battle, in terms of sales. Nintendo had released key games for the SNES such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15738\" href=\"/donkey-kong-country/3030-15738/\" slug=\"donkey-kong-country\">Donkey Kong Country</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\" href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292/\" slug=\"super-metroid\">Super Metroid</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3984\" href=\"/star-fox/3030-3984/\" slug=\"star-fox\">Star Fox</a>, helping sales of their system, and elevating it past the sales of the Genesis with its Sega CD add-on. Not helping any, Sega Released another add-on for the genesis called the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-31\" href=\"/sega-32x/3045-31/\" slug=\"sega-32x\">32X</a> that same year, trying to upgrade the power of their console cheaply, but consumers were not impressed, and the 32X only had a handful of games, many of which were just upgraded ports of older Genesis titles. Even if they lost the battle, the Mega Drive truly captured the hearts of many gamers everywhere, and was Sega's first large success.</p><p style=\"\">Also during 1990 and 1991 the Sega <a data-ref-id=\"3045-5\" href=\"/game-gear/3045-5/\" slug=\"game-gear\">Game Gear</a> was released to all countries. It had a total of 6 games for its launch and then soon spanning over multiple genres and over 300 games. Its game cartridges were not region coded, therefore any game could be played on any hand held anywhere in the world.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4120/492048-slide7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492048\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4120/492048-slide7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492048\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4120/492048-slide7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4120/492048-slide7.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sega Game Gear</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The Game Gear was a portable Master System molded into hand held form.

The Saturn was touted as a 32-bit 2D console, even though it did have some 3D games being developed for it, Sega was really pushing the 2D games. However, The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" slug=\"playstation\">Playstation</a> won over the hearts of US gamers, and was penned as a 3D specific console, tailored specifically for 3D games. The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">N64</a> had a similar approach, in that it was tailored specifically for 3D gaming. Not only that, but it was released around the same time as the Playstation in the US. Both the Playstation and N64 did marvelously in the US, and Sega abandoned the Saturn in three years. However in Japan the Saturn did much better, outselling the Playstation into 1996, and defeating the N64. The Saturn was the most successful console Sega ever produced in Japan, but the same success was not shared in the U.S.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/381284-800px_dreamcast_set_orange.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381284\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58875\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/381284-800px_dreamcast_set_orange.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381284\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/381284-800px_dreamcast_set_orange.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6087/381284-800px_dreamcast_set_orange.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Sega Dreamcast, US Region Release.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After the Saturn was discontinued, people were wondering what Sega would do next. They decided to produce a console called the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-37\" href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" slug=\"dreamcast\">Dreamcast</a>. Released in the US on the mystifying date of 9/9/99, the console saw lots of commercial success within its first year because of the technical superiority to the N64 and Playstation. Its major focuses were on innovative and fun gameplay, it was also the first console to feature online play. The Dreamcast was also the first console to feature a modem port built directly into the back of their console. The games released for the system were innovative, fun, and graphically stunning, including one of the first cel-shaded games, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20096\" href=\"/jet-grind-radio/3030-20096/\" slug=\"jet-grind-radio\">Jet Grind Radio</a>. Sega also released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\" href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/\" slug=\"sonic-adventure\">Sonic Adventure</a> at the launch of the system, making Sonic Sega's mascot once again. Other titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1442\" href=\"/seaman/3030-1442/\" slug=\"seaman\">Seaman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16519\" href=\"/samba-de-amigo/3030-16519/\" slug=\"samba-de-amigo\">Samba de Amigo</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\" href=\"/shenmue/3030-7812/\" slug=\"shenmue\">Shenmue</a> were all innovative and fun, and received good press. It was definitely a big step up from the Saturn, but Sony was already planning a follow-up to the Playstation, called the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">PS2</a>. The PS2 was released in October 2000, and received generally average press until 2001, when more great games began coming out. On top of that, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-340\" href=\"/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/\" slug=\"microsoft-game-studios\">Microsoft</a> entered the market with the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-32\" href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" slug=\"xbox\">Xbox</a>'s release in 2001. Nintendo had another console in store for the market as well, the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" slug=\"gamecube\">GameCube</a>, which was released in November 2001. The Dreamcast at this point was, sadly, only an afterthought. What had Sega done wrong? They released their console too early, and all of the bad press from the Saturn carried over to the Dreamcast through the company's then-tarnished reputation. In 2002, Sega officially discontinued the Dreamcast; therewith announcing that they would only be developing software from that point forward.</p>"

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Activision was originally founded on October 1, 1979 and became the first independent developer and distributor of video games with its first games developed for the <a href=\"/atari-2600/3045-40/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600</a>. Activision was founded by former music industry executive Jim Levy along with former Atari programmers <a href=\"/david-crane/3040-29662/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-29662\">David Crane</a>, <a href=\"/larry-kaplan/3040-70508/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-70508\">Larry Kaplan</a>, <a href=\"/alan-miller/3040-33236/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33236\">Alan Miller</a>, and Bob Whitehead. Activision's first game release came in the form of <em><a href=\"/\">Dragster</a></em> in 1980, with their first big hit being <a href=\"/pitfall/3030-10014/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10014\"><i>Pitfall!</i></a> in 1982. <i>Pitfall!</i> quickly became one of best selling Atari 2600 games ever selling over 4 million copies.</p><p style=\"\">On June 13, 1986, Activision merged with <a href=\"/infocom/3010-1284/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1284\">Infocom</a> due to Jim Levy being a big fan of the company and did not want to see them fall. Six months later, Bruce Davis, who was heavily against the merger, became CEO of Activision. In 1989, the Infocom studios were finally closed by Activision putting 21 out of 26 employees out of business.</p><p style=\"\">In 1988, Activision moved on to produce more software outside of the video game industry and changed its corporate name to Mediagenic. Activision continued to develop video games, however, for many platforms including the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>, <a href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Sega Master System</a>, <a href=\"/atari-7800/3045-70/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-70\">Atari 7800</a>, <a href=\"/atari-st/3045-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-13\">Atari ST</a>, <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a>, and <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In the following years, Mediagenic had multiple financial issues including patent infringement suits and eventually was taken over by Robert Kotick, an investor group lead. The company eventually filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and merged with <a href=\"/disc-company-the/3010-5348/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5348\">The Disc Company</a>. Mediagenic started to rise out of bankruptcy, made some strategic acquisitions, and changed its name back to Activision in December 1992. Activision also moved its headquarters from Mountain View in the Silicon Valley to Santa Monica, CA deciding as well to produce only video games from that point on.</p><p style=\"\">In 1991, Activision released <i><a href=\"/the-lost-treasures-of-infocom/3030-11772/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11772\">The Lost Treasures of Infocom</a></i> which was a package of 20 Infocom games on one disc.

With the success of Suikoden 2, Suikoden was established as an RPG franchise that would spawn several sequels and spin-offs.<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/929623-206_silent_hill2_1b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929623\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/929623-206_silent_hill2_1b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929623\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/929623-206_silent_hill2_1b.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/929623-206_silent_hill2_1b.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Silent Hill 2 is the sequel to Konami's PS1 venture into the survival horror genre.</figcaption></figure><br/>Another of Konami's major franchises is <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4312\" href=\"/silent-hill/3030-4312/\" slug=\"silent-hill\">                                 Silent Hill</a>, released in 1999 as their response to other survival horrors of the time, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\" href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842/\" slug=\"resident-evil\">                                 Resident Evil</a>.

However, he did not become particularly famous until his work on Metal Gear Solid on the PS1.  The game enjoyed both critical and financial success and, like several other Konami franchises, would be followed by many sequels, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12388\" href=\"/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/3030-12388/\" slug=\"metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty\">                                 Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. </a>The game was given more attention than its predecessor, from the movie-level production values to portions of the music having been written by Hollywood talent. It would become a big seller for the Playstation 2, but was criticized for its overly long cutscenes and confusing story. However, it was still successful enough to warrant a follow-up:  <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\" href=\"/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/3030-18082/\" slug=\"metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater\">                                 Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater</a> .

It employed many of the features Sons of Liberty did, like improved cinematics and aiming in a first person view. When the Playstation 3 came out, Konami released the final game in the Metal Gear storyline: <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\" href=\"/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/3030-20669/\" slug=\"metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\">                                 Guns of the Patriots</a>. Upon release, it earned notable amounts of praise.<br/><br/>As of today, Konami is a very high profile video game company. They have a large dedicated fan base and create games for a wide range of platforms."

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Acclaim Entertainment was founded in 1987 and went out of business in 2004. The company also published games under the labels <a href=\"/ljn-ltd/3010-1870/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1870\">LJN</a> and <a href=\"/arena-entertainment/3010-432/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-432\">Arena</a>. While Acclaim did publish numerous games that were developed in-house, the company also had a long-standing relationship with <a href=\"/midway-games/3010-185/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway</a>, which resulted in home versions of several Midway arcade games, including <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\">Mortal Kombat</a> and <a href=\"/terminator-2-judgment-day/3030-5207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5207\">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Aside from software development and publishing, Acclaim also published some strategy guides. In 1994, Acclaim bought Valiant Comics (later renamed to Acclaim Comics). The company eventually adapted several of the former Valiant's intellectual properties into video game form, including <a href=\"/turok/3025-254/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-254\">Turok</a> and <a href=\"/shadow-man/3025-368/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-368\">Shadowman</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Acclaim's fortunes dimmed in later years due to diminishing sales combined with a string of bad publicity. The company had a licensing agreement with <a href=\"/dave-mirra/3040-32770/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32770\">Dave Mirra</a> to create BMX titles, but when they attempted to tie Mirra's name to the horrendously juvenille <a href=\"/bmx-xxx/3030-5474/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5474\">BMX XXX</a>, Mirra filed suit against Acclaim for misuse of his likeness. The Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, also sued Acclaim at one point, claiming that the company wasn't doing enough to support their license by releasing a series of substandard titles. Eventually, Acclaim's financial woes grew too severe to sustain operation and the company was forced to declare bankruptcy. All of Acclaim's assets, including its full library of releases and the name of the company itself were sold at auction to finance the company's liquidation. The Acclaim name was scooped up for a reported $100,000 by former <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a> employee <a href=\"/howard-marks/3040-6433/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-6433\">Howard Marks</a>, who founded <a href=\"/acclaim-games/3010-6257/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6257\">Acclaim Games</a> as a publisher of smaller-scale free-to-play online games.</p><h2>Marketing Stunts</h2><p style=\"\">Acclaim was notorious for promoting some of their games with peculiar publicity stunts. One example was an attempt to pay people to place advertisements for the game Shadowman on the tombstones of deceased relatives. Similarly, Acclaim also offered compensation for new parents that named their baby Turok in honor of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter.</p><h2>Development Studios</h2><p style=\"\">The following Studios were part of Acclaim Entertainment Inc.:</p><ul><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/acclaim-studios-austin/3010-1532/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1532\">Acclaim Studios Austin</a> (former Iguana Entertainment )</li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/acclaim-studios-cheltenham/3010-89/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-89\">Acclaim Studios Cheltenham</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/acclaim-studios-london/3010-1892/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1892\">Acclaim Studios London</a> (former Probe Entertainment)</li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/acclaim-studios-manchester/3010-6069/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6069\">Acclaim Studios Manchester</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/acclaim-studios-salt-lake-city/3010-1301/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1301\">Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City</a> (former Sculptured Software)</li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/acclaim-studios-teesside/3010-1748/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1748\">Acclaim Studios Teesside</a></li></ul>"

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">On September 23 1889, <a href=\"/f-yamauchi/3040-26751/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-26751\">Fusajiro Yamauchi</a> founded Nintendo Koppai, a small Japanese business based in <a href=\"/kyoto/3035-1372/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1372\">Kyoto,</a> <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>, which produced and marketed a playing <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=13/\">card game</a> called <a href=\"/hanafuda-card-games/3015-7399/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7399\">Hanafuda</a>. The name Nintendo translates to \"leave luck to heaven.\" Originally, Yamauchi produced all of the cards himself, painting them by hand- but as the business grew in popularity, he had to hire assistants to keep up with demand.</p><p style=\"\">In 1956, Fusajiro Yamauchi's grandson <a href=\"/hiroshi-yamauchi/3040-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-615\">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> went to visit and began talks with the leading playing card manufacturer in the the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">US</a>, The United States Playing Card Company. Realizing the limitations of the playing card business, <a href=\"/hiroshi-yamauchi/3040-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-615\">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> acquired the licenses to <a href=\"/disney-interactive-inc/3010-1312/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1312\">Disney</a>'s characters and put them on Nintendo's playing cards to help drive sales. The company was renamed in 1963 from Nintendo Playing Card Company Limited to Nintendo Company, and began experimenting in other ventures and other areas of business. In just 5 years from 1963 to 1968, Nintendo expanded to include a taxi company, a \"Love Hotel\" chain, a TV station and a food company which sold instant rice - similar to the popular instant noodles in Japan. However the new business ventures did not last and were eventually closed, and Nintendo was left with 60 Yen in stock with a dwindling playing card market.</p><p style=\"\">Undeterred by its failed business ventures, Nintendo refocused its business strategy to the Japanese toy industry. Nintendo's first toy was the <a href=\"/ultra-hand/3055-4932/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4932\">Ultra Hand</a>, an extending arm that was developed by <a href=\"/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Gunpei Yokoi</a> in his free time. <a href=\"/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Yokoi</a> was promoted from the company's maintenance engineer to product developer in Nintendo's newly formed Nintendo Games department. Nintendo continued to produce popular toys, including the <a href=\"/ultra-machine/3055-5779/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5779\">Ultra Machine</a>, Love Tester, and the Kousenjuu series of <a href=\"/light-gun/3015-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\">light gun</a> games; the Kousenjuu, produced in partnership with <a href=\"/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6509\">Sharp</a>, were the first light guns available for home use. Despite some successful products, Nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required of the toy market, and fell behind the well-established companies such as <a href=\"/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-272\">Bandai</a> and <a href=\"/tomy/3010-1326/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1326\">Tomy</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Nintendo's business strategy again re shifted in 1973 to family entertainment with the Laser Clay Shooting System, using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo's Kousenjuu series of toys, and set up in abandoned <a href=\"/bowling/3015-3451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3451\">bowling</a> alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines for the emerging arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs, Nintendo had found a new untapped market.</p><h2>Video Games</h2><p style=\"\">Nintendo's roots in the video game industry began as early as 1971. That was the year when they began working with <a href=\"/magnavox/3010-1164/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1164\">Magnavox</a> on the <a href=\"/shooting-gallery/3030-43951/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43951\">Shooting Gallery</a> <a href=\"/light-gun/3015-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\">light gun</a>, building on their experience with the Kousenjuu light guns. According to video game historian <a href=\"http://gamestudies.org/1302/articles/picard\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Martin Picard</a>: \"<i>in 1971, Nintendo had -- even before the marketing of the first home console in the United States -- an alliance with the American pioneer Magnavox to develop and produce optoelectronic guns for the Odyssey (released in 1972), since it was similar to what Nintendo was able to offer in the Japanese toy market in 1970s</i>\".</p><p style=\"\">In 1974, Nintendo went on to create the <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=35/\">light-gun shooter</a> electro-mechanical <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> game <a href=\"/wild-gunman/3030-4116/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4116\">Wild Gunman</a>, and they they were given the rights to distribute the <a href=\"/magnavox/3010-1164/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1164\">Magnavox</a> <a href=\"/odyssey/3045-74/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-74\">Odyssey</a> home video game system in Japan. It wasn't until 1977 that Nintendo began to make its own video game console - four systems to be exact, each playing variations on a single game; for example, Color TV Game 6 featured six versions of Light Tennis. The Color TV Game was Nintendo's first success with video games in Japan. During this time, Nintendo hired student product developer <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, who worked under <a href=\"/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Gunpei Yokoi</a>. One of <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Miyamoto</a>'s projects at Nintendo was to design the casing for several of the Color TV Game systems and went on to create some of Nintendo's most famous video games. He has since become one of the most recognizable faces in the video game industry today.</p><p style=\"\">Nintendo moved into the arcade video game industry in 1978, which produced little success at first. They began gaining some modest success in the arcades with <a href=\"/sheriff/3030-27792/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27792\">Sheriff</a> and <a href=\"/radar-scope/3030-20776/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20776\">Radar Scope</a>, though the latter became a flop in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a> despite its modest success in Japan. It was not until Nintendo launched the <a href=\"/game-watch/3025-1183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1183\">Game &amp; Watch</a> (a hand-held video game series developed by <a href=\"/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Yokoi</a>) in 1980 and especially the 1981 arcade release of <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3030-311/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-311\">Donkey Kong</a>, designed by <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Miyamoto</a>, that Nintendo began to see worldwide success and a huge boost in profits.</p><p style=\"\">The Family Computer, or the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom</a> as it was more commonly called, was launched in 1983 in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> with ports of its most popular arcade titles. The system launched in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a> as the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES) in 1985, and was accompanied by <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.</a>, which became the best-selling video game of all time, and remained so for the next three decades (up until the 2006 release of <a href=\"/wii-sports/3030-13328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13328\">Wii Sports</a>). The NES was credited with reviving the declining North American video game industry. The <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> was superseded by the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Famicom</a>, known outside <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> as the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (<a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a>), which introduced shoulder buttons and <a href=\"/25d/3015-660/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-660\">pseudo-3D</a> <a href=\"/sprite-scaling/3015-7122/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7122\">tilemap scaling</a> to console gaming. The <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>, most notable for its <a href=\"/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D graphics</a> capabilities, introduced the analog stick and multi-player for up to four players instead of two. The Nintendo <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> followed, and was the first Nintendo system to use optical disc storage instead of cartridges, and popularized the use of wireless contollers. The <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> then introduced accelerometer-based <a href=\"/motion-control/3015-474/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-474\">motion sensing</a> controllers and had a more developed <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online</a> functionality, used for services such as <a href=\"/nintendo-wi-fi-connection/3015-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2131\">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a>, <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> and <a href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-87\">Wii Ware</a>. The latest Nintendo console is the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a>, which uses a <a href=\"/touch-controls/3015-2256/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2256\">touch-screen</a> controller.</p><p style=\"\">Nintendo's hand-held video game market grew in parallel with its home console counterpart. After the Game &amp; Watch, hand-held development continued with the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>, followed soon after by the Super Game Boy and <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a>, each differing in minor aspects. The <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> continued for more than a decade until the release of the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, featuring technical specifications similar to the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES.</a> The <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> SP, a front lit, flip-screen version with a lighted screen, introduced a rechargeable built-in battery that replaced the AA batteries of its predecessors. The next Nintendo hand-held console was the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> which utilizes <a href=\"/dual-monitor-arcade-games/3015-3686/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3686\">two screens</a>, the bottom of which is a <a href=\"/touch-interface/3015-1415/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1415\">touchscreen</a>. It also offers online functionality, and possesses technical power similar to that of the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64.</a> Nintendo soon released the DS Lite, a smaller and lighter version of the hand-held. The next redesign of the DS was the DSi which increased the size of the the screens, offered a DSi shop, and allowed users to take pictures with a built-in camera. The DSi XL offered even larger screens. Nintendo's most recent hand-held, the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a>, allows <a href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\">stereoscopic 3D</a> effects without the use of <a href=\"/3-d-glasses/3055-1919/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1919\">glasses</a>, i.e. <a href=\"/autostereoscopy/3015-7492/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7492\">autostereoscopic</a> 3D.</p><p style=\"\">Today, Nintendo Company Ltd. is the longest-surviving video game console manufacturer to date, outlasting <a href=\"/atari/3010-182/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari</a> and <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a>.

It was founded in February 1995 by <a href=\"/ray-muzyka/3040-12762/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12762\">Ray Muzyka</a>, <a href=\"/greg-zeschuk/3040-12808/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12808\">Greg Zeschuk</a>, and <a href=\"/augustine-yip/3040-41980/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41980\">Augustine Yip</a>. Zeschuk and Muzyka previously completed medical degrees at the University of Alberta. Zeschuk has recently finished his MBA at Queen's School of Business. Yip left the company in 1997 to return to medicine, but Zeschuk and Muzyka remained and still acted as heads of the studio untill they left the company in 2012.</p><p style=\"\">Bioware is famous for such <a href=\"/dungeons-dragons/3025-167/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-167\">Dungeon and Dragons</a> inspired games as <a href=\"/baldurs-gate/3030-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-52\">Baldur's Gate</a> and <a href=\"/neverwinter-nights/3030-9953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9953\">Neverwinter Nights</a>. The company originally developed games exclusively for the PC platform, but In 2003 the company released <a href=\"/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/3030-18741/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18741\">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</a> for the <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a>. This game was the first of several games that Bioware would develop for <a href=\"/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a>'s consoles.

It was based in Orange County, California. The division was formed during 1996, adopting the name \"Black Isle Studios\" during 1998.

It used pictures made by Chmielarz in his trip to Saint-Tropez. To make the photographs useful, he had to edit them to remove his friend, whit whom he went to France. 5 thousand copies of the game was sold, which was a big success in post-communism reality in Poland.<br/><br/>Next game developed by Metropolis was followed by unprecedented marketing campaign. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12358\" href=\"/teenagent/3030-12358/\" slug=\"teenagent\">   Teenagent</a>, released in 1995, is believed to be one of the best polish adventure games.

Visceral Games shares a location with EA's corporate headquarters in Redwood Shores, CA. Visceral also keeps a branch office in Montreal, Canada; a former branch in Melbourne, Australia, was closed in September, 2011.</p><h2>Development History</h2><p style=\"\">Dead Space is the most recent and name-making game franchise produced by Visceral games. Dead Space was pitched by the lead designer of Visceral Games to EA executives after getting tired of working on teen- or lower-rated titles. EA granted a small development team within Visceral Games a six month period in which to flesh out their design to demonstrate its potential as a full-scale production. Rather than going the traditional route of producing an in-depth design document for their game; Visceral created a vertical slice prototype of their game, which they decided to call Dead Space. The motivation behind this approach was that the team felt that tangible hands-on experience with a piece of their game would sell the game far better than would trying to merely describe it.</p><p style=\"\">The first Dead Space was released in 2008 and met with very positive reception both critically and commercially. As of August 3, 2010, EA reported that the game had sold upwards of 2 million copies. The game was acclaimed as a successful blend of survival horror and third-person shooting, a pairing spearheaded by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\" href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" slug=\"resident-evil-4\">Resident Evil 4</a>, with modernizations for the current console generation. The game also introduced 'strategic dismemberment' as a central gameplay mechanic. Dead Space 2 launched in 2011 and has received a similarly positive reception. Critics have praised the game as a successful, archetypical sequel: more of what was good in the last game, less of what wasn't.</p><p style=\"\">Visceral Games has been rumored to currently be working on a downloadable title for <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2623\" href=\"/playstation-network/3015-2623/\" slug=\"playstation-network\">PSN</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">XBLA</a> called The Ripper.</p>"

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">In 1991, Epic was just one man, <a href=\"/tim-sweeney/3040-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-6849\">Tim Sweeney</a>, working out of his parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Under the name Potomac Computer Systems, Sweeney developed and released a simple DOS game, <a href=\"/zzt/3030-2735/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2735\">ZZT</a>, one of the first ever games that could be easily modified with a scripting language. Distributed through BBSes and and mail order, ZZT spread like wildfire as users latched on to the ability to create new levels and new game types with the editor tools. Using the steady income stream from ZZT's popularity, Sweeney decided to step things up a notch and came up with the name Epic MegaGames to compete with major players in the shareware industry - or in <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4035/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php?page=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">his words</a>, \"I realized that we needed a serious name, so I came up with 'Epic MegaGames' -- kind of a scam to make it look like we were a big company.\"</p><p style=\"\">Under this new name, and the success of ZZT under his belt, Sweeney quickly was able to parlay his abilities into a production and management role, collaborating with other developers to release titles that quickly took the early/mid 90's DOS game world by storm. Epic MegaGames was the name behind classics like <a href=\"/jill-of-the-jungle/3030-18541/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18541\">Jill of the Jungle</a> (a Sweeney solo effort), <a href=\"/jazz-jackrabbit/3030-7634/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7634\">Jazz Jackrabbit</a> (with <a href=\"/cliff-bleszinski/3040-9856/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9856\">Cliff Bleszinski</a> and <a href=\"/arjan-brussee/3040-14912/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-14912\">Arjan Brussee</a>), <a href=\"/epic-pinball/3030-12199/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12199\">Epic Pinball</a> (with <a href=\"/james-schmalz/3040-6830/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-6830\">James Schmalz</a>) and <a href=\"/kens-labyrinth/3030-14462/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14462\">Ken's Labyrinth</a> (one of the first FPS's, with <a href=\"/ken-silverman/3040-13287/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-13287\">Ken Silverman</a>.)</p><p style=\"\">Around late 1994, the Epic team decided to channel all of their resources, financial and otherwise, into a wildly ambitious project: <a href=\"/unreal/3030-17646/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17646\">Unreal</a>. At the time, the cutting edge of 3D gaming was <a href=\"/doom-ii-hell-on-earth/3030-621/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-621\">Doom II</a>, and Unreal was, from the beginning, designed to be an engine with three full dimensions of freedom, dynamically located sound, dynamic lighting, and other features now taken for granted. On top of this, Sweeney and the Epic team added a real-time, in-engine editing system, UnrealEd. After years of development, the game was released in May, 1998 to wide critical acclaim. The <a href=\"/unreal-engine-1/3015-1919/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1919\">Unreal Engine</a> was considered a stellar technical achievement, at least as good as its primary competitor, <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id Software</a>'s <a href=\"/quake-ii/3030-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3207\">Quake II</a> engine, and was rolled into a package to be licensed to other development companies.

    "description": "<p style=\"\">Data East Corporation was founded by Tetsuo Fukuda on April 20, 1976. Originally, the company was focused on hardware, namely interchangable tapes and parts inside arcade cabinets. Data East actually developed the first cartridge-based arcade system, the  DECO Casette System, which was released in 1980.<br/><br/>It wasn't until 1979 that Data East began developing and publishing software. During the 1980's, Data East released some of the biggest arcade hits of the era including <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4702\" href=\"/burgertime/3030-4702/\" slug=\"burgertime\">            Burgertime</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10261\" href=\"/bad-dudes/3030-10261/\" slug=\"bad-dudes\">            Bad Dudes Vs. Dragon Ninja</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4864\" href=\"/robocop/3030-4864/\" slug=\"robocop\">            RoboCop</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7250\" href=\"/karate-champ/3030-7250/\" slug=\"karate-champ\">            Karate Champ</a>. PC and console ports of many of these games were also commissioned and were rather successful. Data East also purchased licenses from companies such as Capcom, SNK, and Irem in order to manufacture and create arcade games based on their unique properties. It was this string of popular arcade and console hits that allowed Data East to weather the video game crash of 1983 better than most other companies.<br/><br/>Data East is also well known as a developer and manufacturer of pinball tables. In 1985, the company purchased the pinball division of Stern Electronics including all of its factories and assets. During their time in the pinball market, Data East advanced pinball technology with many innovations such as stereo sound and dot matrix displays which are still commonly found in pinball games today. Data East primarily developed pinball tables that featured high-profile licensed properties such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21899\" href=\"/guns-n-roses/3030-21899/\" slug=\"guns-n-roses\">           Guns N' Roses</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29599\" href=\"/star-wars/3030-29599/\" slug=\"star-wars\">          Star Wars</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34189\" href=\"/robocop/3030-34189/\" slug=\"robocop\">         RoboCop</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26734\" href=\"/the-simpsons/3030-26734/\" slug=\"the-simpsons\">       The Simpsons</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34176\" href=\"/batman/3030-34176/\" slug=\"batman\">      Batman</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34192\" href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/3030-34192/\" slug=\"teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles\">     Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.<br/><br/>During the early 1990's, Data East began to struggle financially. Data East spent a lot of money in acquiring expensive high-profile licenses for their pinball tables, and thus, when the market for pinball games began to shrink and sales plummeted, Data East was hit very hard. In 1994, Data East USA was sold to Sega as a part of debt settlement and later on in 1996 the entire pinball division of Data East was sold to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" slug=\"sega\">    Sega</a>. In 1999, Sega sold all pinball assets that formerly belonged to Data East to Gary Stern who used it to create the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2694\" href=\"/stern-electronics-inc/3010-2694/\" slug=\"stern-electronics-inc\">            Stern Pinball company</a>. From 1999 to 2003, Data East sold electronics components and licensed out some of their game properties in the hopes of recovering from their financial woes and gaining enough capital to begin making games again. However, these efforts were not enough to save the company, and on June 25, 2003, Data East Corporation was declared bankrupt by a Tokyo district court. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3961\" href=\"/paon-corporation-ltd/3010-3961/\" slug=\"paon-corporation-ltd\">   Paon Corporation, Ltd</a>. bought the rights to some of Data East's games, and have since released some of them on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-87\" href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87/\" slug=\"wii-shop\">  Wii virtual console</a>. However, the vast majority of the Data East properties were acquired in February 2004 by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1973\" href=\"/g-mode-inc/3010-1973/\" slug=\"g-mode-inc\"> G-Mode</a>, a Japanese mobile games publisher. G-Mode has gone on to release mobile versions of several of Data East's arcade classics, but they are currently attempting to sell many of the licenses. G-Mode currently has deals in place to release Data East titles on the Wii virtual console and Gametap among other places.</p>"

Interplay does continue to exist as a publicly traded company with Hervé Caen as CEO and is reportedly working on new internally developed projects.</p>"

This single platform introduced many of the classic games that continually come up in any conversation of highly revered classics for many people's childhood (and/or young adulthood) memories. In the end, the first incarnation of Atari (right up to the purchase by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98032\" href=\"/jack-tramiel/3040-98032/\">Jack Tramiel</a> in 1984) represents a historic time in history for the video game industry. Many of the cornerstones were built right here with this company, and the story is just as interesting simply because it rekindles memories within so many of the people that have come to be major forces in leading the gaming industry to where it is today.</p><h2>1972-1975: The Roots of the Gaming Industry</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1361966-250px_pongvideogamecabinet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1361966\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.644\" data-width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1361966-250px_pongvideogamecabinet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1361966\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1361966-250px_pongvideogamecabinet.jpg\"></a><figcaption>An Original Atari Pong Cabinet</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Atari's naming was of special significance to <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89534\" href=\"/nolan-bushnell/3040-89534/\">Nolan Bushnell</a>, as it was named after his favorite game - Japan's centuries old classic Go. The term \"atari\" is used by Go players to politely inform their opponent that they are about to be overrun. The company was created in 1972 with money earned by Bushnell's first game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20713\" href=\"/computer-space/3030-20713/\">Computer Space</a>. While this initial game was not considered to be a success financially, it seeded the ideas for the game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22195\" href=\"/pong/3030-22195/\">Pong</a>, which would become the first gaming classic the budding gaming industry would see. By most gaming historians, this is considered to be the true birth of the gaming industry as it sparked countless knock-offs, and eventually brought video games into the home. Until now, video games were not considered mass market items, and had not penetrated into people's lives like this would.</p><p style=\"\">Far simpler than most games of the time, the idea of Pong was an electronic version of ping pong. It may be said that it is the simplicity that sparked the imagination of the masses in America, bringing video games to the mass market for the first time. It was no longer only relegated to the likes of computer engineers and college researchers. First marketed as a coin-operated machine placed in restaurants and bars, the game captured the hearts and minds of America. Headlines and nightly news shows sang the praises of this new form of entertainment that was quickly spreading across the nation like wildfire. Atari's Pong created a market for clones, and unfortunately its own version was quickly marginalized in the same market that it helped create. Many of the knock-offs managed to corner a vast majority of the market. Within two years of the games introduction in late 1972, only 10% of the cabinets produced were sold.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1363963-c100_small.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363963\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.58\" data-width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1363963-c100_small.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363963\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1363963-c100_small.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1363963-c100_small.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">What profits were made were quickly invested in many projects and ventures that, in hindsight, come across as shortsighted and nonproductive. The financial burden of half a million dollars used to try and penetrate the Japanese market with their products proved to be one of the largest blows to both the founders when it eventually failed and was aborted. None of the successive arcade games that they produced managed to incite the imaginations and hearts of Americans like Pong did, forcing Atari to think of a much different strategy in their own fight to stay solvent and survive within this burgeoning market. Taking a cue from <a data-ref-id=\"3045-74\" href=\"/odyssey/3045-74/\">Magnavox's Odyssey</a>, which was the first home console created, Atari entered into a partnership with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-907\" href=\"/sears-roebuck-and-co/3010-907/\">Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company</a> to create their own platform. Sears, becoming the sole retailer, agreed to purchase all 100,000 units built, signaling the introduction of Pong for the home in the fall of 1975. It proved to be quite a success as Sears saw a huge demand for this game during 1975's holiday season. While the Odyssey is considered to be the first hole console, it was Atari's PONG (and the many successive iterations) that would capture the majority of people's mind share.</p><h2>1976-1981: Atari's Golden Age</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1363980-atarivcs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363980\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.51333333333333\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1363980-atarivcs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363980\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1363980-atarivcs.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1363980-atarivcs.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari VCS (aka Atari 2600)</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While the success of PONG managed to help Atari gain a lifeline, it was not a panacea for their problems. What was brewing underneath was much more complicated, and the financial problems were only the beginning of what would eventually lead to the sale of Atari to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Communications\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warner Communications</a> in 1976 for $28 - $32 Million (est .). The reality was that their PONG machines could only be used for one game, and the same people that lined up in droves in late 1975 quickly become disinterested with this single-minded novelty. The release of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502\" rel=\"nofollow\">MOS Technology 6502</a> in 1976, gave Atari the ability to put a CPU in what would become their VCS ( <a data-ref-id=\"3045-40\" href=\"/atari-2600/3045-40/\">Atari 2600</a>) that was both cost effective and powerful enough to make it the multi-game console that they were looking to release.</p><p style=\"\">In 1977 Atari was able to release what would become their lasting legacy, the Atari 2600. This machine allowed players to play several games on one console. During the first holiday season in 1977, the 2600 did not manage to supplant the PONG machines, and was met with stiff competition from several other manufacturers that had built multi-game machines as well. The reality was that for as much as the 2600 would eventually signal in a golden age for Atari, this initial response was a huge burden on the company financially.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1365960-300px_atari_400p8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365960\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.76333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1365960-300px_atari_400p8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365960\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1365960-300px_atari_400p8.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1365960-300px_atari_400p8.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari 400</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The majority of 1978 did not bring much change to the companies outlook, as more strife was brewing between the employees and leadership of Atari and the heads of Warner Communications. All of the internal chaos culminated in a budget meeting in New York where Bushnell was ousted from his position as chair of the company. In his place, several executives were hired that had a stronger business background within larger corporations. The ensuing months represented a large change in focus, as a $6 million ad campaign was put into place at the tail-end of 1978 aiming to clear out the backlogged inventory that most retailers had, making way for new games that would be coming out shortly thereafter. This brought about a huge turnaround in their financial viability as they were able to create a buzz around the 2600 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 1979, with store owners demanding more products to sell.</p><p style=\"\">Over the course of the next year (1979) they were able to sell all of their stock of machines that were manufactured to retailers. Atari would enjoy an ever increasing lion's share of the home console market through 1981, with $740 million worth of cartridges and consoles being sold over this time period. Great financial success came from the large profit margins built into the release of each game cartridge, which at its peak, were being produced at a rate of one each month. The only competition came from Mattel's <a data-ref-id=\"3045-51\" href=\"/intellivision/3045-51/\">Intellivision</a> in 1980, but the 2600 managed to overcome its strong ad campaign, remaining the console of choice for the vast majority of households (80% market share by the end of 1981)</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1365959-300px_atari_800_2008_new.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365959\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.79666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1365959-300px_atari_800_2008_new.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365959\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1365959-300px_atari_800_2008_new.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1365959-300px_atari_800_2008_new.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari 800</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Another arm of Atari was forming concurrently to the team that headed up the research and development of the 2600. This part of the company was focused on the burgeoning home computer market, and they tried to produce the most powerful machine on the market. Both the Atari <a data-ref-id=\"3045-24\" href=\"/atari-8-bit/3045-24/\">800</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-24\" href=\"/atari-8-bit/3045-24/\">400</a>, being aimed at this new market, were met with strong competition from the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-12\" href=\"/apple-ii/3045-12/\">Apple II</a>. This division initially lost an estimated $10 million, but was more than offset with the strong profits that the 2600 was able to produce for Atari as a whole. By the end of 1981 the home computing division managed to become profitable, dominating the sales of low-priced home computers.</p><h2>1982-1984: The Slow Fall From Grace</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1366049-sys_atari5200_4port_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1366049\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.68820678513732\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1366049-sys_atari5200_4port_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1366049\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1366049-sys_atari5200_4port_a.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1366049-sys_atari5200_4port_a.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari 5200</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even with the great successes that Atari manged to produce through the end of 1981, a larger concern was starting to brew. With their emphasis on new software products being the companies main focus, they did not put enough attention into a true successor to the 2600 early enough. The only hardware products that had been introduced were expensive add-ons that did not manage to gain any traction at retail (i.e. a remote control model known as Touch Me). A large amount of their financial resources were quickly put into research and development of the 2600's true successor - what would ultimately become the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-67\" href=\"/atari-5200/3045-67/\">Atari 5200</a>. Many analysts truly felt that Atari would remain at the front of the home console market, possibly indefinitely, but stiff competition from other hardware and software companies proved to be the beginning of their eventual fall from grace. Upwards of 30 other game makers launched onto the scene, all vying for a piece of the ever-growing market share; one of these companies being Nintendo, which would eventually take the world by storm with the release of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\">Famicom</a> (released in Japan in 1983) and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\">NES</a> (released in the rest of the world in 1985).</p><p style=\"\">In a financial call during December 1982, Warner Communications would announce that their previous sales estimates would have to be reduced because they could not be met due to \"unexpected cancellations and disappointing sales during the first week of December.\" The harsh reality was that many of Atari's lead game designers were leaving to go to other companies, delivering a blow to the company that they would not be able to recover from. The eventual fallout from this financial call would soon become debilitating as the stock's price would plummet dramatically and several Atari executives would be investigated by the SEC for insider trading. While all charges would eventually be dropped, the repercussions were already set into motion, causing 1,700 US workers to be laid off and all US manufacturing facilities to be moved to Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1366057-atari_logo.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1366057\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1916666666667\" data-width=\"120\" style=\"width: 120px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27929/1366057-atari_logo.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1366057\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1366057-atari_logo.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27929/1366057-atari_logo.gif\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Redesigned logo for Atari Corporations</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The prognosis was not any better in Atari's home computing division, as it was also being met with stiff competition from other computing manufacturers. Even with significant cuts to the price of the 400, total losses for the company in the first quarter of 1983 reached $46 million. Nolan Bushnell was approached by Atari to try and reinvigorate the former innovative luster that it had, but even this was not enough to stimey the eventual losses that they would incur. The one bright light came with Nintendo, as they approached Atari to enter into a partnership to produce the hardware for the NES/Famicon. The June 1983 CES was to be the forum in which they would both sign and announce their deal, but the entire agreement dissolved after <a data-ref-id=\"3010-302\" href=\"/coleco/3010-302/\">Coleco</a> demoed Nintendo's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-311\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3030-311/\">Donkey Kong</a> on their new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco_Adam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam computer</a> . Nintendo would eventually decide to make their own hardware, and the downward spiral of Atari's finances came to a head shortly after, culminating in a mass layoff of 10,000 employees - nearly half of the company.</p><p style=\"\">In July of 1984, a $240 million deal was struck between Atari and ex-head of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2000\" href=\"/commodore/3010-2000/\">Commodore</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98032\" href=\"/jack-tramiel/3040-98032/\">Jack Tramiel</a>, and all of Atari was sold except for the small coin-operated arcade business, Ataritel. Immediately following the sale, Tramiel began aggressive cost cutting measures, laying off hundreds more employees and making strong efforts to collect on all unpaid debts and balances. Because so many unwanted game cartridges were unable to be sold, Atari dumped truckloads of them into a New Mexico landfill. Atari would eventually be renamed <a data-ref-id=\"3010-794\" href=\"/atari-games-corporation/3010-794/\">Atari Corporation</a> and would never be able to regain control of the console market, or have the same amount of clout that they had during the peak of the 2600's popularity.</p>"

Midway has developed and published some of the most successful arcade and home console games ever made, including the <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3025-7/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-7\">Mortal Kombat</a> series, <a href=\"/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6332\">Ms. Pac-Man</a> and <a href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\">Space Invaders</a>. However, the company began to experience net losses and eventually filed for bankruptcy in February 2009. In July 2009 Midway’s assets were purchased by Warner Brothers, who retained the Mortal Kombat studio in which would become <a href=\"/netherrealm-studios/3010-2545/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2545\">NetherRealm Studios</a> in June 2010.</p><h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Midway Manufacturing was one of the earliest American video game developers, though it initially kept to the <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> market. This, and its early success, was facilitated by a strong link with <a href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-135\">Taito</a> that lasted throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, leading to the distribution rights for Taito games. Midway began branching into the home market with its one and only attempt at developing a home system in the form of the <a href=\"/bally-astrocade/3045-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-120\">Bally Astrocade</a>, named after the company that purchased Midway in 1969.</p><p style=\"\">The real breakthrough success that had somewhat alluded Midway finally came in the form of the distribution of Space Invaders, followed closely by Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. Midway became the foremost arcade developer in the US, putting out titles such as <a href=\"/defender/3030-5536/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5536\">Defender</a>, <a href=\"/nba-jam/3030-16928/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16928\">NBA Jam</a> and <a href=\"/spy-hunter/3030-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10448\">Spy Hunter</a>. After years of developing under first the Bally name and, later on, the Williams name, Midway adsorbed the Williams video game division and started working under their own name again.</p><p style=\"\">In 1992, Midway put out a quickly developed arcade fighter, intended to serve as a competitor to <a href=\"/street-fighter-ii/3030-243/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-243\">Street Fighter II</a>. <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\">Mortal Kombat</a> would go on to define the company, and become one of the most popular arcade and home console games created.

Over this period, Midway began cutting ties with its previous form, and terminated its part in the <a href=\"/pinball/3045-83/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-83\">pinball</a> industry. Midway also cut its arcade manufacture, citing financial losses year over year. Over the next eight years Midway began buying up a number of existing third party developers, hoping to expand and solidify its development abilities. It was here that Midway began experiencing the financial problems that would lead them to bankruptcy. Between 2004 and 2007, Midway began experiencing net losses each year but continued on until February 12, 2009, when it filed for bankruptcy.</p><p style=\"\">Midway’s assets were purchased on July 1, 2009 by Warner Bros.

The game was a giant success which made Maxis develop many more sequels and expansions as well as some non-Sim games (such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19320\" href=\"/robosport/3030-19320/\" slug=\"robosport\">RoboSport</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25199\" href=\"/3d-pinball-space-cadet/3030-25199/\" slug=\"3d-pinball-space-cadet\">3D Pinball</a> for Windows).</p><h3>Financial Troubles and Buy-Off by EA</h3><p style=\"\">Following the success of SimCity, Maxis experimented with different genres and ultimately-failed. Financial troubles were also caused by the acquisition of Cinematronics, LLC to publish the debacle Crucible. This ultimately forced Maxis to accept take-over offers. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1\" href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" slug=\"electronic-arts\">EA</a> bought Maxis in 1997 and with them published the most successful PC franchise of all time, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-282\" href=\"/the-sims/3025-282/\" slug=\"the-sims\">The Sims</a>. They also made two SimCity sequels and the more recent <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14139\" href=\"/spore/3030-14139/\" slug=\"spore\">Spore</a>.</p><h2>Famous Franchises Developed by Maxis</h2><p style=\"\">Maxis is well known for their innovative games which most of the time don't have an end goal or a win-lose condition, making the game almost endless.</p><h3>SimCity</h3><p style=\"\">SimCity was the first game developed by Maxis. In this game the player is a mayor tasked with running the city and turning it from a small village to a successful metropolis by taking care of the economy and public services.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">The Creative Assembly is a Sussex, UK-based game development studio that was founded by <a href=\"/tim-ansell/3040-13180/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-13180\">Tim Ansell</a> in 1987. Though The Creative Assembly has worked in other genres, the company has become predominantly known for its <a href=\"/total-war/3025-265/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-265\">Total War</a> series of strategy games.</p><h2>Electronic Arts</h2><p style=\"\">The Creative Assembly started to make sports title for Electronic Arts back in 1993 under the EA sports banner. Franchises developed included Rugby World Cup, 1999 Cricket World Cup and Austrailain Football Leauge. In 1999, Creative Assembly had the budget and resources to develop a brand new strategy game called <a href=\"/shogun-total-war/3030-8407/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8407\">Shogun: Total War</a>. Originally designed to be a knock off of the Command and Conquer games, it ended up using its own formula of gameplay, using turn based strategy in the campaign map and real time strategy for the battles. When released on June 13, 2000, the game got much praise and won numerous strategy game of the year awards in 2000. In 2001, Creative Assembly announced it would release <a href=\"/shogun-total-war-the-mongol-invasion/3030-5209/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5209\">Shogun: Total War - Mongol Invasion</a> as an expansion pack. This would be the last Creative Assembly release under the EA banner as the Creative Assembly broke from EA and got Activision as its new publisher.</p><h2>Activision</h2><p style=\"\">In 2001, the Creative Assembly announced a new Total War game under development, this time set in medieval Europe. This was <a href=\"/medieval-total-war/3030-19641/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19641\">Medieval: Total War</a>, which was even bigger and more technically advanced than Shogun. When released in August 2002, it sold better than Shogun, garnished much praise and won many awards, including the top game of 2002 award from PC Gamer.</p><p style=\"\">The third total war game to be developed was <a href=\"/rome-total-war/3030-19887/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19887\">Rome: Total War</a>, which was announced by the Creative Assembly in early 2003. The engine was much different to how previous installments were made, as for the first time in the franchise's history, troops in the battles were in 3D. This new engine was so innovative, that television shows like History Channel's Decisive Battles and BBC's TIme Commanders used this new engine to add realistic graphics as to how ancient armies fought from the Roman Era. After its release in September 2004, the game became the most well-received iteration of the Total War franchise, one of the top ten best selling PC games of 2004 and won nearly every strategy game of the year award from the press.</p><h2>Sega's Buyout and Creative Assembly Today</h2><p style=\"\">After Rome's great success in 2004, many thought the Creative Assembly would stay with Activision. However on March 9 2005, it was announced that Sega had bought all shares in the company and acquired the British-based developer. Sega wanted to make its presence in European and North American markets greater and saw the Creative Assembly as an opportunity to help sell in the Western video game markets. In 2005, Sega had published two games developed by the Creative Assembly, <a href=\"/rome-total-war-barbarian-invasion/3030-9264/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9264\">Rome: Total War, Barbarian Invasion</a>, which was the expansion pack to Rome: Total War, and <a href=\"/spartan-total-warrior/3030-18951/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18951\">Spartan: Total Warrior</a>. Spartan was an action game that played much like God of War, which was released earlier in 2005. Despite being seen by some as a God of War clone, the game still got mostly favorable reception from the press.</p><p style=\"\">The first non-expansion Total War title published by Sega would be <a href=\"/medieval-ii-total-war/3030-4685/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4685\">Medieval 2: Total War</a>. The game was a sequel to Medieval: Total War, but used the same technology of Rome Total War. While it was not as successful as Rome, Medieval 2, like its previous installments, got critical acclaim and sold well.</p><p style=\"\">After Spartan: Total Warrior, the Creative Assembly had developed more multi-platform console games to see if they could have a console franchise that would be as successful as the Total War franchise. The next console game was <a href=\"/viking-battle-for-asgard/3030-20621/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20621\">Viking: Battle For Asgard</a>, which was another action game that was set in Norse mythology. The game got mixed reviews, for some praised it for having brutal battles, it was also panned for having inconsistent sound design and a lackluster plot. In June 2008, the Creative Assembly announced a multi-platform strategy game called <a href=\"/stormrise/3030-21105/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21105\">Stormrise</a>. This game would be developed by the Creative Assembly's Australian branch, who was also behind developing Medieval 2: Total War. However, the game soon became the Creative Assembly's worst received title to date getting criticisms like having a terrible control design and flawed pathfinding. Right now the Creative Assembly is working on a tentative Alien title for the consoles, but nobody knows when it will be released.</p><p style=\"\">As for the Total War franchise, the Total War series is still the flagship franchise of the Creative Assembly. In 2009, <a href=\"/empire-total-war/3030-20509/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20509\">Empire: Total War</a> was released, being set in colonial times going from the 18th century to the early 19th century. Empire also got a brand new engine to fit the combat that took place in the game's setting. The game outsold both Medieval 2: Total War and Rome: Total War and was highly praised by the media upon release. However, the game was often criticized by fans and customers for having many glitches, hinting that perhaps the game wasn't complete when released to the public. In 2010, <a href=\"/napoleon-total-war/3030-27879/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27879\">Napoleon: Total War</a> was released which had a similar gameplay technique and had addressed most of the problems that Empire had. Also like Empire, it got great praise from the media, but some questioned if a game playing much like Empire should of been sold as a retail game or just as an expansion pack. In 2011, the most recent Total War installment, <a href=\"/shogun-2-total-war/3030-31531/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31531\">Total War: Shogun 2</a>, was released, serving as the sequel to the first Total War title, Shogun: Total War. The game has gotten universal praise and has won many strategy game of the year awards for 2011. Most recently The Creative Assembly has announced <a href=\"/total-war-rome-ii/3030-38867/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38867\">Total War: Rome II</a>.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Games</b></p><h3>Total War Games</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/shogun-total-war/3030-8407/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8407\">Shogun: Total War</a></li><li><a href=\"/shogun-total-war-the-mongol-invasion/3030-5209/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5209\">Shogun: Total War - Mongol Invasion</a></li><li><a href=\"/medieval-total-war/3030-19641/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19641\">Medieval: Total War</a></li><li><a href=\"/medieval-total-war-viking-invasion/3030-16978/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16978\">Medieval: Total War - Viking Invasion</a></li><li><a href=\"/rome-total-war/3030-19887/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19887\">Rome: Total War</a></li><li><a href=\"/rome-total-war-barbarian-invasion/3030-9264/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9264\">Rome: Total War, Barbarian Invasion</a></li><li><a href=\"/rome-total-war-alexander/3030-341/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-341\">Rome: Total War - Alexander</a></li><li><a href=\"/medieval-ii-total-war/3030-4685/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4685\">Medieval 2: Total War</a></li><li><a href=\"/medieval-ii-total-war-kingdoms/3030-13453/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13453\">Medieval 2: Total War - Kingdoms</a></li><li><a href=\"/empire-total-war/3030-20509/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20509\">Empire: Total War</a></li><li><a href=\"/napoleon-total-war/3030-27879/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27879\">Napoleon: Total War</a></li><li><a href=\"/shogun-2-total-war/3030-31531/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31531\">Total War: Shogun 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/total-war-rome-ii/3030-38867/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38867\">Total War: Rome II</a></li></ul><h3>Other Work</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/rugby/3030-596/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-596\">Rugby</a></li><li><a href=\"/rugby-2001/3030-28108/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28108\">Rugby 2001</a></li><li><a href=\"/spartan-total-warrior/3030-18951/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18951\">Spartan: Total Warrior</a></li><li><a href=\"/viking-battle-for-asgard/3030-20621/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20621\">Viking: Battle For Asgard</a></li><li><a href=\"/stormrise/3030-21105/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21105\">Stormrise</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/alien-isolation/3030-44296/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44296\">Alien: Isolation</a></li></ul>"

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">The 3DO company was founded by co-founder of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\" slug=\"ea-games\">EA Games</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-18128\" href=\"/trip-hawkins/3040-18128/\" slug=\"trip-hawkins\">Trip Hawkins</a>, under the name of SMSG, Inc in 1991. The name was later dropped and the company became the 3DO Company. The 3DO Company is responsible for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-26\" href=\"/3do/3045-26/\" slug=\"3do\">3DO</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-687\" href=\"/heroes-of-might-and-magic/3025-687/\" slug=\"heroes-of-might-and-magic\">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> franchise. The company disappeared in 2003 after filing for bankruptcy.</p><h2>Making the 3DO</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/11349-Trip Hawkins.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11349\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/11349-Trip Hawkins.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11349\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\"></a><figcaption>Trip Hawkins</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The 3DO Company was created with one objective in mind: to make a console. And not just any console. A console where games would be played on a CD (this was a revolutionary idea at the time since most games still came on cartridges) and developing games for the console would be cheap (royalties were only $3 per game). The 3DO company lived on these royalties and saved money by outsourcing the construction of their console. This was also a revolutionary way of doing business at the time, building their console like an airplane. They'd get parts from different companies shipped to their factories where the console would be assembled. Production costs were low meaning that the royalties could be low. This business structure was designed to compete with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" slug=\"sega\">Sega</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> who were charging developers more in royalties to make games on their consoles.</p><p style=\"\">The 3DO launched in 1993 at 699$. Despite a massive marketing push and third party support, the console was a failure. It was in part due to the price but also in part due to the fact that wind had already broken that Nintendo was developing a new console that would be more powerful than the 3DO. As the 3DO Company's stock dropped and despite the 1996 price cut, the 3DO Multiplayer System was discontinued at the end of 1996.</p><p style=\"\">This led to some major changes at 3DO. First of all, they were forced to abandon the successor of the 3DO, the M2. Second of all, the whole company was restructured in order to specialize in game developing.</p><h2>Developing games</h2><p style=\"\">In order to develop quality games, 3DO acquired <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6066\" href=\"/archetype-interactive-corp/3010-6066/\" slug=\"archetype-interactive-corp\">Archetype Interactive</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1774\" href=\"/cyclone-studios/3010-1774/\" slug=\"cyclone-studios\">Cyclone Studios</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-503\" href=\"/new-world-computing-inc/3010-503/\" slug=\"new-world-computing-inc\">New World Computing</a>. The 3DO company developed many games over their 12 years of existence, most notably <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6457\" href=\"/army-men/3030-6457/\" slug=\"army-men\">Army Men</a> and Heroes of Might and Magic.</p><p style=\"\">Despite developing games for all systems, the 3DO company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2003 and had to sell most of their licenses to competitors.</p>"

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">The company that would eventually become Krome Studios started life as several Australian splinter companies, founded years apart.</p><p style=\"\">Melbourne House was founded in the UK in 1978 as Melbourne House--for the purpose of publishing books--by Australian ex-pats <a data-ref-id=\"3040-42090\" href=\"/alfred-milgrom/3040-42090/\" slug=\"alfred-milgrom\">Alfred Milgrom</a> and Naomi Besen. Seeing the success of the burgeoning video game industry in the US and Japan, they retooled that business plan in 1980 to involve localization and importation of US games for the UK market. Fortuitously, soon after the announcement of this change, the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-938\" href=\"/sinclair-research-ltd/3010-938/\" slug=\"sinclair-research-ltd\">Sinclair</a> ZX80 was released. Milgrom jumped on this opportunity by writing a book for the home computer market and distributing it through his own company. The book was a success, and it convinced the two founders that they could make money by focusing entirely on the video game market.</p><p style=\"\">The founders returned to Melbourne and founded Beam Software in late 1980 to localize and import US games to a largely-untapped Australian market (essentially the same business plan as Melbourne House, minus the book publishing). 1981 was largely spent publishing software for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-30\" href=\"/vic-20/3045-30/\" slug=\"vic-20\">VIC-20</a> and Sinclair ZX81, but in 1982 Beam released its first in-house production <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9936\" href=\"/the-hobbit/3030-9936/\" slug=\"the-hobbit\">The Hobbit</a> for the newly-released <a data-ref-id=\"3045-16\" href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16/\" slug=\"zx-spectrum\">ZX Spectrum</a>. The Spectrum would go on to become one of the most popular video game platforms in UK/Australian history, and The Hobbit would eventually go on to become one of the best-sellers for the Spectrum. This early success cemented the company's market position, and allowed the company to hire more programmers for in-house games.</p><p style=\"\">By 1987, the company was entirely focused on Beam's work importing and creating video games for the English-speaking market, and it jettisoned the Melbourne House name to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-425\" href=\"/mastertronic-ltd/3010-425/\" slug=\"mastertronic-ltd\">Mastertronic</a>. Beam also made history in this year by becoming the second non-Japanese company to receive a developer license for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">NES</a>, in exchange for promising <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> that it would discontinue the sales of its (<i>extremely</i> unauthorized) NES development system.</p><p style=\"\">In 1988, the mega-media conglomerate <a data-ref-id=\"3010-176\" href=\"/virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-176/\" slug=\"virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc\">Virgin Group</a> purchased Mastertronic, obtaining Melbourne House in the deal. However, Virgin already had a strong name-brand in its Virgin Games label, and they shuttered Melbourne House entirely.</p><p style=\"\">1996 saw Beam Software make two major corporate changes, by both becoming the first publicly-listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange under the name Beam International Ltd., and re-registering the trade name \"Melbourne House,\" which Virgin had allowed to lapse.</p><p style=\"\">Just three years later, in 1999, Beam International sold all of its game development and publishing operations--which now consisted of over 130 employees in a number of offices--to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-548\" href=\"/atari-sa/3010-548/\" slug=\"atari-sa\">Infogrames</a>. The studio was renamed Infogrames Melbourne House. At the same time, Krome Studios was founded by Steve Stamatiadis and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-31793\" href=\"/robert-walsh/3040-31793/\" slug=\"robert-walsh\">Robert Walsh</a> for the purposes of developing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6330\" href=\"/championship-surfer/3030-6330/\" slug=\"championship-surfer\">a one-off PC surfing game</a>. However, the company was able to expand rapidly due to both a vast field of local programmers and Australia's relative paucity of video game development companies (and--at least in part--due to management mistakes at Beam).</p><p style=\"\">Beleaguered Infogrames embarked on a large internal rebranding effort in 2003, changing its name to Atari, and Infogrames Melbourne House therefore became Atari Melbourne House... for all of three years, when it was purchased by upstart rival Krome. This made Krome the largest video game development company in Australia, rivaled only by much-smaller development houses like <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6487\" href=\"/team-bondi/3010-6487/\" slug=\"team-bondi\">Team Bondi</a>. It has continued localizing and releasing games locally, while developing one or two in-house titles per year.</p><p style=\"\">In 2010, Krome scored what seemed to be a coup when it announced it had licensed a large number of classic games for the PC/360-exclusive <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30021\" href=\"/game-room/3030-30021/\" slug=\"game-room\">Game Room</a> platform.</p>"

By the mid-1960's the company had moved to making plastic moldings, and by 1976  with Arnold Greenberg, the company had gotten into the video game business with the release of the Telstar. Shortly after, Coleco moved into the handheld market which at the time was dominated by Mattel. After a string of competetive and educational handheld releases, Coleco once again dove into the home console market with the Release of the Colecovision in 1982. But due to the video game crash  in 1983, sales for all home consoles fell dramatically especially with the rise of the Personal Computer. To counteract the falling console sales, Coleco released their own version of the personal computer with the Coleco Adam. This ended up being a monumental failure for the company and not even the successes of the Cabbage Patch Kids and ALF dolls could keep the company from going under. In 1988, Coleco filed for Bankruptcy and by 1989 their assets were purchased by another huge toy company, Hasbro. In 2005, the Coleco brand was reintroduced by River West Brands     with the introduction of the Coleco Sonic which contains and emulates 20 Sega Master System and Game Gear games. </p><p style=\"\"> </p>"

Mission Critical featured a lengthy strategy section in which the player commands a starship in battle, and Superhero League of Hoboken was structured as a first-person RPG similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-849\" href=\"/bards-tale/3025-849/\" slug=\"bards-tale\">Bard's Tale</a>, with adventure game style puzzle scenes occurring at important locations.</p><p style=\"\">During this period, the company also developed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1719\" href=\"/star-control-3/3030-1719/\" slug=\"star-control-3\">Star Control 3</a>, sequel to the much loved <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7030\" href=\"/star-control-ii/3030-7030/\" slug=\"star-control-ii\">Star Control 2</a> created by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1567\" href=\"/toys-for-bob/3010-1567/\" slug=\"toys-for-bob\">Toys for Bob</a>. The game was not well-received by fans and suffered from poor sales.</p><h2>Action &amp; First-Person Shooters</h2><p style=\"\">In 1998, the company was acquired by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-479\" href=\"/gt-interactive-software-corp/3010-479/\" slug=\"gt-interactive-software-corp\">GT Interactive</a>, which was then itself acquired by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-548\" href=\"/atari-sa/3010-548/\" slug=\"atari-sa\">Infogrames</a>, and for the most part stopped production on the adventure games it had been known for, focusing instead on first-person shooters.

They released their games or parts of their games in \"episodes\". Usually the first one would be free and the additional episodes were to be ordered separately, a business model which became known as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1324\" href=\"/shareware/3015-1324/\" slug=\"shareware\">shareware</a>. This was a risky business model, considering the Internet had still been in its pioneering stages in the early 90s and the distribution was done via phone and mail. Apogee released many games which are now considered cult classics and pioneers in their respective genres, including <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5403\" href=\"/rise-of-the-triad-dark-war/3030-5403/\" slug=\"rise-of-the-triad-dark-war\">Rise of The Triad</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\" href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" slug=\"wolfenstein-3d\">Wolfenstein 3-D</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16253\" href=\"/raptor-call-of-the-shadows/3030-16253/\" slug=\"raptor-call-of-the-shadows\">Raptor</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12544\" href=\"/wacky-wheels/3030-12544/\" slug=\"wacky-wheels\">Wacky Wheels</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8191\" href=\"/duke-nukem/3030-8191/\" slug=\"duke-nukem\">Duke Nukem</a> series, which Apogee re-released in 2008, following a long phase of hiatus, for various handheld systems. Some of these games were merely published by Apogee, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\" href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" slug=\"wolfenstein-3d\">Wolfenstein</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21209\" href=\"/commander-keen/3030-21209/\" slug=\"commander-keen\">Commander Keen</a>, which had been developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-347\" href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" slug=\"id-software\">id Software</a>.</p><h2>3D Realms</h2><p style=\"\">Apogee planned to create a separate brand for all genres their release strategy might cover, yet it turned out to be unnecessary, as the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-480\" href=\"/3d-realms-entertainment/3010-480/\" slug=\"3d-realms-entertainment\">3D Realms</a> brand, created for \"3D\" games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\" href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/\" slug=\"duke-nukem-3d\">Duke Nukem 3D</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18105\" href=\"/terminal-velocity/3030-18105/\" slug=\"terminal-velocity\">Terminal Velocity</a> proved to be the only successful sub-brand that was worth continuation. Later on, the original name Apogee was dropped altogether in favour of the newer, more successful brand that was <a data-ref-id=\"3010-480\" href=\"/3d-realms-entertainment/3010-480/\" slug=\"3d-realms-entertainment\">3D Realms</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\" href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/\" slug=\"duke-nukem-3d\">Duke Nukem 3D</a> was by far the most successful and appraised game by 3D Realms, however, they released other successful FPS shooters in the form of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-515\" href=\"/max-payne/3025-515/\" slug=\"max-payne\">Max Payne</a> series and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16372\" href=\"/prey/3030-16372/\" slug=\"prey\">Prey</a>. The last original game to be released by 3D realms as developer and not a publisher however has been <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17746\" href=\"/shadow-warrior/3030-17746/\" slug=\"shadow-warrior\">Shadow Warrior</a> in 1997.</p><p style=\"\">The long awaited sequel to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\" href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/\" slug=\"duke-nukem-3d\">Duke Nukem 3D</a>, called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20721\" href=\"/duke-nukem-forever/3030-20721/\" slug=\"duke-nukem-forever\">Duke Nukem Forever</a> had been in development for over 12 years and widely considered <a data-ref-id=\"3015-121\" href=\"/vaporware/3015-121/\" slug=\"vaporware\">vaporware</a> by many users and game sites.

At a board meeting at Softdisk in 1990, <a href=\"/john-carmack/3040-4576/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4576\">John Carmack</a> introduced a groundbreaking technique to develop rapid side-scrolling graphics on a <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. Carmack and co-worker <a href=\"/tom-hall/3040-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1\">Tom Hall</a> worked through the night developing a replica of the first level of <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a> using stock images from co-worker <a href=\"/john-romero/3040-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2\">John Romero</a>'s game, <a href=\"/dangerous-dave-in-the-haunted-mansion/3030-13490/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13490\">Dangerous Dave</a>. When Romero saw Carmack and Hall's creation, he knew that Carmack had made something special.</p><p style=\"\">Unknown to Softdisk, the three men designed a full carbon copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 on the PC, hoping to license the game to <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>. Unfortunately, Nintendo turned down the trio. However, this caught the attention of <a href=\"/scott-miller/3040-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1868\">Scott Miller</a> of <a href=\"/apogee-software-ltd/3010-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-346\">Apogee Software</a>. Miller began to contact John Romero through a series of fan letters. Once Romero caught on, Miller realized this was necessary or Softdisk would become aware of the three. Miller suggested the three making shareware games to start out with. They \"borrowed\" the Softdisk computers and started development on platformer, <a href=\"/commander-keen/3030-21209/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21209\">Commander Keen</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The game was released on December 14, 1990 and was published by Scott Miller's Apogee Software. Soon after this, Softdisk learned of the three's plans. However, they were able to reach an agreement. Carmack, Hall and Romero were able to get away with it and form their own studio if they provided a game for Softdisk every 2 months. The three agreed and on February 1, 1991, id Software was born.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/547907-980128405_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-547907\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.626\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/547907-980128405_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-547907\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/547907-980128405_00.gif\"></a><figcaption>Hovertank - id's first FPS game</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">id first sold their games in the same way they sold Commander Keen, through shareware distribution with Apogee Software. id would start by selling the first title of their trilogies through shareware than sell the next two via mail order. For <a href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\">Wolfenstein 3D</a> and <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a>, distinct sequels were created for the retail market (based on the same engine and assets), but starting with <a href=\"/quake/3030-8015/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8015\">Quake</a> the more conventional retail model was adopted from the outset. id quickly became famous for their game engines which were frequently licensed to other developers. After the Keen engine, id would go on to develop the Wolfenstein 3D engine, the Wolfenstein 3D slopes engine, Doom engine, Quake, <a href=\"/quake-ii/3030-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3207\">Quake II</a> and <a href=\"/quake-iii-arena/3030-3874/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3874\">Quake III</a> engines, Doom 3 technology ( <a href=\"/id-tech-4-engine/3015-1383/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1383\">id Tech 4</a>), the MegaTexture technology, and the upcoming <a href=\"/id-tech-5/3015-1385/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1385\">id Tech 5</a>. Commander Keen was id's first big success. Commander Keen gained a cult following from the gamers and spawned a large series of titles. Wolfenstein 3D was their next big hit and essentially created the 3D first person shooter genre. Wolfenstein 3D was followed by its less successful prequel, <a href=\"/spear-of-destiny/3030-12813/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12813\">Spear of Destiny</a>.</p><p style=\"\">After Wolfenstein 3D, id launched its biggest hit yet, Doom. Doom had the best graphics of any PC game to date and garnered mainstream media attention based on its popularity and violent, dark imagery. Doom was followed by the just as successful <a href=\"/doom-ii-hell-on-earth/3030-621/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-621\">Doom II</a>, which was technically very similar to the original. 2 years later, id's next hit first person shooter was born, Quake. Quake featured an all new full 3D game engine and the groundbreaking ability to play deathmatch across the internet. Quake spawned three sequels in <a href=\"/quake-ii/3030-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3207\">Quake II</a>, the online-focused <a href=\"/quake-iii-arena/3030-3874/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3874\">Quake III: Arena</a> and a direct follow-up to <a href=\"/quake-ii/3030-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3207\">Quake II</a>, <a href=\"/quake-4/3030-13683/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13683\">Quake 4</a>. id allowed various developers to revisit their franchises with new adaptions on the series. The first of this was <a href=\"/return-to-castle-wolfenstein/3030-19181/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19181\">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a>, developed by <a href=\"/gray-matter-interactive-studios-inc/3010-2075/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2075\">Gray Matter Interactive</a> and <a href=\"/nerve-software-llc/3010-1083/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1083\">Nerve Software</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Return to Castle Wolfenstein was the first <a href=\"/wolfenstein/3025-210/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-210\">Wolfenstein</a> game with online multiplayer. The next published game was <a href=\"/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/3030-8614/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8614\">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a>, an online-only take on the Wolfenstein series developed by <a href=\"/splash-damage-ltd/3010-1082/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1082\">Splash Damage</a>. It was soon revealed that this break was due to id's development on <a href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\">Doom 3</a> which was released in 2004. Doom 3 once again revolutionized graphics on a PC but received a mixed reception from series fans. id returned to production after Doom 3, collaborating with <a href=\"/raven-software/3010-1841/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1841\">Raven Software</a> for <a href=\"/quake-4/3030-13683/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13683\">Quake 4</a>, <a href=\"/fountainhead-entertainment-inc/3010-1418/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1418\">Fountainhead Studios</a>' cell phone games <a href=\"/doom-2-rpg/3030-22738/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22738\">Doom RPG</a> and <a href=\"/orcs-elves/3030-16108/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16108\">Orcs &amp; Elves</a>, and finally, Splash Damage's Quake spin-off, <a href=\"/enemy-territory-quake-wars/3030-18883/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18883\">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</a>. They have also released a heavily revised version of Quake 3 Arena as a browser-based game, <a href=\"/quake-live/3030-21388/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21388\">Quake Live</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In 2009, id Software released several of their classic games on the Apple's App Store with ports of Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Rage. They also released new titles like <a href=\"/wolfenstein-rpg/3030-27927/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27927\">Wolfenstein RPG</a>, <a href=\"/doom-resurrection/3030-27011/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27011\">Doom Resurrection</a> and <a href=\"/doom-ii-rpg/3030-22738/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22738\">Doom II RPG</a>.</p><p style=\"\">On October 4, 2011, id released its highly anticipated new IP called <a href=\"/rage/3030-20672/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20672\">Rage</a> that utilized the latest id Tech 5 engine. It was originally to be published by <a href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts</a> after id announced a partnership with EA, ending their long exclusive relationship with <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a> but was finally published by Bethesda, id's current parent company. Rage received positive reviews but didn't sell well, resulting several <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2012/01/10/bethesda-confirms-layoffs-at-id-software-work-on-future-id-tit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">employee layoffs</a> on January 10, 2012. <a href=\"/raven-software/3010-1841/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1841\">Raven Software</a> released a new <a href=\"/wolfenstein/3030-21119/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21119\">Wolfenstein</a> game in 2009 but it too didn't do well sales wise, which resulted a major layoff at Raven.</p><p style=\"\">Currently, <a href=\"/doom-4/3030-20654/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20654\">Doom 4</a> is in the works but neither John Carmack nor Tim Willits is heavily involved with the project.</p><h2>Acquisition by Bethesda</h2><p style=\"\">On June 24, 2009, id Software was acquired by Zenimax Media, the parent company of <a href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-786\">Bethesda</a>. This was considered a surprise move, especially on id's part due to their history as being a staunchly independent developer. The full press release can be found <a href=\"/bethesda-parent-company-purchases-id-software/1100-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-1469\">here</a>. Following the acquisition, Bethesda later acquired the publishing rights for Rage, ending the short stint with Electronic Arts. Other companies that were considered to be part of a merger with id were Activision, <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a> and <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a>, but id chose Bethesda because it \" <a href=\"http://www.gametrailers.com/video/press-conference-quakecon-2009/54275\" rel=\"nofollow\">felt more secure with larger companies</a>.\"</p><h2>id Mobile</h2><p style=\"\">Sometime in 2008, id Software established a development team to work on mobile games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Their first release was <a href=\"/wolfenstein-rpg/3030-27927/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27927\">Wolfenstein RPG</a> in 2009, followed by Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom Classic, <a href=\"/doom-resurrection/3030-27011/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27011\">Doom: Resurrection</a>, <a href=\"/doom-ii-rpg/3030-22738/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22738\">Doom II RPG</a> and Rage HD.</p><p style=\"\">In a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-iVFxgFWk\" rel=\"nofollow\">keynote</a> at QuakeCon 2012, John Carmack revealed that the id Mobile developers have shifted their efforts on bigger projects, thus halting the mobile game development indefinitely.</p><h2>The Company Name</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/2074080-id_software_oldlogo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074080\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88461538461538\" data-width=\"104\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 104px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/2074080-id_software_oldlogo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074080\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/2074080-id_software_oldlogo.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/2074080-id_software_oldlogo.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"id\" used to look like this</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The company was originally called Ideas From the Deep but they decided to shortened it to simply id, which stands for \"in demand,\" and is pronounced as in \"did\" or \"kid.\" The name also had another meaning which is referring to id, one of the three parts (The other two being ego and super-ego) of the brain that behaves by the pleasure principle. Even though id has since moved on, Ideas From The Deep still exists to this day as a mobile gaming company but it no longer has any relationship with id Software.</p><h2>The id Tech Engines</h2><p style=\"\">id software is known for its game engines that many developers and games have used. They were primarily created and designed by John Carmack and as an advocate of open-source, he would release the source code on the web for the fans and mods once it has reached its mature stage. From the beginning, Carmack doesn't believe in patenting his game engines and is not interested in licensing them because of his desire to devote his time working on new technology and not to provide technical support to third-party developers constantly.</p><p style=\"\">The id Tech 1, 2 and 3 engines were widely licensed by various gaming companies like <a href=\"/raven-software/3010-1841/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1841\">Raven Software</a>, <a href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve Corporation</a>, <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a>, <a href=\"/splash-damage-ltd/3010-1082/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1082\">Splash Damage</a> and <a href=\"/human-head-studios-inc/3010-1628/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1628\">Human Head Studios</a>. The <a href=\"/half-life/3025-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-293\">Half-Life</a>, <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a> and <a href=\"/star-wars/3025-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a> games were made possible thanks to the id Tech engines. The id Tech 4 was the least popular engine thanks to its biggest competitor Epic Games (creators of the <a href=\"/unreal-engine-1/3015-1919/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1919\">Unreal Engine</a>) that provided better development tools and genre scope. <a href=\"/epic-games/3010-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic Games</a> approached its gaming licensing seriously and it affected id Software's business to some extend. When asked in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoLaA-CVmTE\" rel=\"nofollow\">2011 interview</a>, Carmack said \"<i>good for [Epic Games]</i>\" and despite losing the engine market by a few percentage, he has no regrets of not pursuing the licensing business.</p><p style=\"\">The id Tech 5 is the latest engine from id. It supports MegaTexture that provides textures with resolutions up to 128,000 pixels x 128,000 pixels. The first game to utilize the id Tech 5 is Rage.</p><h3><u>id tech 1 (aka Doom Engine)</u></h3><figure data-align=\"left\"

Capcom is an abbreviation of CAPsule COMputers, according to the company. As of 2008, Capcom is one of the top fifty largest software companies in the world. Capcom has many incredibly famous franchises, such as <a href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-331\">Street Fighter</a>, <a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a>, and <a href=\"/resident-evil/3025-397/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-397\">Resident Evil</a>.

In their early days, developing games for the arcade, Capcom began many franchises that are still going on today. Their first game was released in 1984, <a href=\"/vulgus/3030-20693/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20693\">Vulgus</a>, but the rest of their early <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> games were scrolling shooters. <a href=\"/1942/3030-10466/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10466\">1942</a> is a scrolling shooter franchise that Capcom created during this period. Later, in 1987, Capcom released the original <a href=\"/street-fighter/3030-1235/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1235\">Street Fighter</a>. The franchise was not very well-received until its sequel was released in 1991, <a href=\"/street-fighter-ii/3030-243/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-243\">Street Fighter II</a>.

On September 29, 2005, <a href=\"/namco/3010-7420/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco</a> officially merged with Japanese toymaker <a href=\"/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-272\">Bandai</a> to form Namco Bandai Holdings Inc., one of the largest entertainment companies in Japan. Namco became a wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company. Then on March 31, 2006, Namco merged with Bandai's video game operations and the US arm of the company was renamed Namco Bandai Games Inc. Meanwhile, the Japanese arm went by Bandai Namco Games, to take advantage of Bandai's larger Japanese precense while capitalizing on the still-recognizable Namco name in the United States. In 2014, the US arm was renamed to Bandai Namco Games America Inc, unifying the names across regions. Bandai Namco Games announced in December 2014 that it would rename itself again and thus would known globally as Bandai Namco Entertainment starting April 1, 2015.</p><p style=\"\">Some of the company's most famous games are <a href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">Pac-Man</a> and the <a href=\"/tekken/3025-333/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-333\">Tekken</a> franchise.

Bandai did have better succes with the <a href=\"/wonderswan/3045-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-65\">WonderSwan</a> handheld game system in Japan in 1999. A year later the company released the <a href=\"/wonderswan-color/3045-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-54\">WonderSwan Color</a>. Both portables saw support from Bandai itself and even from other third party software vendors such as Square, Capcom and Taito, but ultimately the WonderSwan was defeated in the market by the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> and the <a href=\"/neo-geo-pocket/3045-80/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-80\">Neo Geo Pocket</a>.</p>"

Hudson sold 1.2 million copies of <a href=\"/lode-runner/3030-636/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-636\">Lode Runner</a>, their second game after its release in 1984. They would go on to develop video games for the <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Famicom</a>, <a href=\"/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">NEC PC</a>, <a href=\"/msx/3045-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX</a> and the <a href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-16\">ZX Spectrum</a> respectively and was reorganized from a shop to a serious software developer under the name Hudson Soft Co., Ltd in November 1984.

The game received mixed reviews, but became the center of a small controversy when the editorial staff at PC.IGN received a letter from Psygnosis PR which discussed Psygnosis' opinion that PC.IGN was not an editorially sound body. The full letter reads:</p><blockquote><p style=\"\">Dear Trent,</p><p style=\"\">With Drakan topping the SoftTrend charts at #2 in August and with sales of the game moving very strongly forward it is sad that we have to write to inform you that we think IGN's review of Drakan, even with a fairly decent score, does not reflect what we deemed IGN to be on the editorial caliber scale, both in style and in content - nor does it reflect an awareness of actual consumer opinion as seen in the actual sales of the game.</p><p style=\"\">Rather, the review of Drakan is quite demeaning and juvenile sounding, stooping lower than PCXL while really missing the whole point of the game. Unfortunately, we have to tell you that the message we get from the both the beginning and end of this review seems to focus only on the female body, to put it nicely. We're aware of the audience that IGN is targeting, so why even the negative feel from the beginning of the review? While some of the gameplay comments are good and fair in between, there is a hefty amount of contradiction and way too much personal interjection. In particular, the ridiculous 'Cleavage' interview at the end is very tacky, or to be more blunt, really stupid. Oh please!</p><p style=\"\">From a PR and marketing perspective, we're really tired of such subjective points of view, editorial that ignores the general consumer perspective and fails to commend a game like Drakan that breaks out of genre, graphic and gameplay barriers. Where's the informative content for your readers? Are they really that dense?</p><p style=\"\">As you're probably aware, the review has been posted at EBworld.com and what's even more disconcerting is that there is no score on this page so visitors are only reading discrepant editorial. So, while I'm being banged away at both by an irate developer and senior marketing exec, I also must agree that we can no longer provide editorial content, exclusive opportunities and review materials if this is what we get for a top-selling game.</p><p style=\"\">We have asked that EB take down this review on their site. Do you think this review will really sell more copies of Drakan? If you would like to help us then perhaps you can also take steps to have the review removed from the EB site.</p><p style=\"\">It would be fair and considerate to hear back from you. We realize that you can't answer all the irate emails from publishers about reviews you've posted but this one, we think, warrants an appropriate response.</p>Regards,<br />Psygnosis PR</blockquote><p style=\"\">It is worth noting that the overall score that PC.IGN gave to Drakan was an 8.1 out of 10. IGN published both the full letter from Psygnosis, as well as a response which read:</p><blockquote><p style=\"\"><b>Forward</b>: Normally, we would respond to this letter in private, but since the email was forwarded to our superiors, our coworkers, and even our sales staff, we felt it necessary to respond in kind.</p><p style=\"\">Congratulations on Drakan's continued success. As we said in the review, it was a fun game that we really enjoyed playing, and even recommended to our audience. With that said, we are sorry that you did not find the \"editorial caliber\" of our review to be up to your standards. We suspect that you are not defining editorial caliber the same way we do � a thorough and unbiased examination of the good and bad points of a product. Judging by your letter, it seems your definition of caliber is strongly tied to sales as a benchmark for excellence. The history of PC software is littered with titles that were lambasted by the critics, but enjoyed great sales. Myst, Deer Hunter, and Rebel Assault come to mind immediately, but as you can see from our review, we do not include Drakan in that list.</p><p style=\"\">Your criticism causes us some confusion. As the focus of the game seemed to be very much on selling the sexual appeal of a scantily clad leather-bound woman, a la' Lara Croft, we find it ironic that you accuse us of sounding \"demeaning and juvenile\" when the review that you seem to object to is devoted to our views on your juvenile and demeaning portrayal of a female protagonist. It's not that we don't understand why you would have a character like this; after all, it's proved very lucrative for games like Tomb Raider and SiN, but we find it unnerving that you would try and deny the intentional (and blatant) sexualization of your heroine. Are you trying to suggest that this is historical for the time period, or that the character design was a complete coincidence?</p><p style=\"\">Furthermore, we'd like to think of all of our reviews as being from a subjective viewpoint, so subjective in fact that readers will actually respect our opinions. Our readers are not dense. When they read a review, they expect to hear whether the money that they spend on a new product will be something that will keep them entertained, not whether or not it will make them part of a large group of buyers. If we started reviewing the games in the manner that you suggest, we'd be out of a job very quickly.</p><p style=\"\">What it <i>seems</i> like you're suggesting is that you expect positive coverage in exchange for \"editorial content, exclusive opportunities and review materials.\" We don't agree to such demands, and furthermore, we don't appreciate such threats. Our review scores will remain the same whether or not we receive free copies of your game in the mail. Just as you would think it unfair for us to give the game a bad review if you didn't send us press materials, it's not fair to our audience to score a game higher than it deserves purely in the interest of the beating out the competition.</p><p style=\"\">We're not sure whether our review will really sell more copies of Drakan, and in fact, that's not really our job here at IGNPC. Our job is talk about and review games from an unbiased and independent perspective, just like movie, music, theater, restaurant, or any other sort of artistic analysis. EB World has already made the decision to carry our reviews, both good and bad, as a resource for their consumers, even though it could theoretically affect their sales. We respect EB World's integrity in this matter, and we find it hard to believe that you can't as well.</p><p style=\"\">But all of this is beside the point. <b>We liked Drakan</b>. We gave it a high rating, placing it amongst such peers as Starfleet Command and Tiberian Sun. If your complaints are truly about the mockery of the character you've created to sell your games, then perhaps you shouldn't have made a character with such blatantly disproportionate sexuality.</p><p style=\"\">And thank you for the comparison to PCXL. We enjoy the magazine, and wish it continued success. As for referring to our interview with cleavage as stupid, we prefer to think of that as <i>very</i> blunt.</p><b>Sincerely,</b><br /><b>--</b> <i>IGN Staff</i></blockquote><p style=\"\">Notably, future valve writers Chet Faliszek and Erik Wolpaw became involved in the controversy via their website Old Man Murray. They initially published an article that was extremely sardonic and highly critical of Psygnosis' letter (This article: <a href=\"http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/723.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/723.html</a>) .

Take-Two acquired the rights to the 2K sports license, the baseball and hockey sports from Kush Games and the football and basketball sports from Visual Concepts, as well as the rights to the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20580\" href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-revolution/3030-20580/\">Civilization</a> franchise. The following year, in 2005, Take-Two acquired a number of videogame developers. The company purchased the development house of Irrational Games for approximately $11.4 million, as well as, the development studios Kush Game and Visual Concepts for $32 million. Later that year, it purchased Firaxis for $27 million.</p><p style=\"\">On May 2007, Take-Two agreed to a deal with Oasys Mobile for the introduction of the Sid Meier franchise to the mobile phone market, developed by Firaxis Games, which had been purchased by Take-Two two years before. In March of that same year, Take-Two filed a lawsuit against happiness hater Jack Thompson, in order to halt him from filing a public nuisance in the State of Florida. In September 8, 2008 Take-Two signed an agreement with Ditan Distribution LLC, in which it, Ditan Distribution, agrees to the role of packaging, shipping, and storage functions which Take-Two had previously done by its self through its subsidiary Jack of All Games.</p><h3>Failed Electronic Arts Take Over</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/1064137-1064093_ea_plus_take_two_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064137\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69330453563715\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/1064137-1064093_ea_plus_take_two_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064137\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/1064137-1064093_ea_plus_take_two_super.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Two pieces that didn't fit</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In February of 2008, rival publisher <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1\" href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\">Electronic Arts</a> offered an acquisition deal of Take-Two Interactive Software for approximately two billion dollars. The offer was declined by Take-Two's board of directors. Electronic Arts was not sufficed with a negative on the deal, and so it tried to persuade the company by threatening Take-Two that if it did not accept the offer it would attempt a \"hostile\" take over by convincing Take-Two's shareholders of accepting the deal. The Take-Two board of directors spent an undisclosed amount of money convincing its own shareholders not to accept Electronic Arts' proposal. The shareholders did not sell their stocks in the company, and by September 2008, Electronic Arts let go of the proposal and said in a statement that it had allowed the the two billion dollar proposal expire. In the end, Electronic Arts' hostile take over bid of Take-Two Interactive Software ultimately failed.</p><h2>Development Studios (2K &amp; Rockstar)</h2><p style=\"\"><b>2K</b> (<a data-ref-id=\"3010-360\" href=\"/2k-games/3010-360/\">2K Games</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\" href=\"/2k-sports/3010-1860/\">2K Sports</a>, 2K Play) - Headquarted in Novato, California, USA</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Development Studio</th><th>Location</th></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-7054\" href=\"/2k-china/3010-7054/\">2K China</a></td><td>Shanghai, China</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6511\" href=\"/2k-czech/3010-6511/\">2K Czech</a></td><td>Prague, Czech Republic</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6350\" href=\"/2k-marin/3010-6350/\">2K Marin</a></td><td>Novato, California</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-5780\" href=\"/2k-australia/3010-5780/\">2K Marin, OZ</a></td><td>Canberra, Australia</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-361\" href=\"/firaxis-games/3010-361/\">Firaxis</a></td><td>Hunt Valley, Maryland</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-4951\" href=\"/irrational-games/3010-4951/\">Irrational Games</a></td><td>Quincy, Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-893\" href=\"/visual-concepts/3010-893/\">Visual Concepts</a></td><td>Novato, California</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-876\" href=\"/cat-daddy-games-llc/3010-876/\">Cat Daddy Games</a></td><td>Kirkland, Washington</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=\"\"><b><a data-ref-id=\"3010-1194\" href=\"/rockstar-games/3010-1194/\">Rockstar Games</a></b> - Headquartered in New York, New York, USA</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Development Studio</th><th>Location</th></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-2737\" href=\"/rockstar-vancouver/3010-2737/\">Rockstar Vancouver</a></td><td>Vancouver, Canada</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-3339\" href=\"/rockstar-san-diego/3010-3339/\">Rockstar San Diego</a></td><td>Carlsbad, California</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-3113\" href=\"/rockstar-toronto/3010-3113/\">Rockstar Toronto</a></td><td>Oakville, Canada</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-1484\" href=\"/rockstar-new-england/3010-1484/\">Rockstar New England</a></td><td>Lawrence, Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-3338\" href=\"/rockstar-leeds/3010-3338/\">Rockstar Leeds</a></td><td>Leeds, England</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-1408\" href=\"/rockstar-north/3010-1408/\">Rockstar North</a></td><td>Edinburgh, Scotland</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-1409\" href=\"/rockstar-lincoln/3010-1409/\">Rockstar Lincoln</a></td><td>Lincoln, England</td></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6320\" href=\"/rockstar-london/3010-6320/\">Rockstar London</a></td><td>London, England</td></tr></tbody></table>"

In 1979, IPM changed their name to IREM Corporation. IREM was an acronym for International Rental Electronics Machines, but that was changed in the 1980s to Innovations in Recreational Electronic Media. Irem continued strong until the 1990s. Sales began to fall, and the corporation began to fall apart. People left Irem, including the arcade cabinet department (forming off a separate company known as Apies), and many employees went on to form <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3660\" href=\"/nazca-corporation/3010-3660/\" slug=\"nazca-corporation\">Nazca Corporation</a> (creator of the Metal Slug franchise). However, in 1997 Nanao founded the Irem Software Engineering, Inc., which took control of the remainder of Irem Corporation.</p><p style=\"\">Irem was a strong supporter of Sony's PlayStation Home, developing Spaces, clothing, decorations, and Home-integrated game lobbies.</p><p style=\"\">In the aftermath of the 2011 Touhoku Earthquake Irem canceled two high profile PS3 titles: Bumpy Trot 2 and Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4. Shortly afterwards the director of both games, Kazuma Kujo, left with many key staff to form Granzella inc. Following this Irem removed most of its PlayStation Home spaces and began delisting all non-pachislot games from the PSN, XBLA, and WiiWare services; a process that was finished in August of 2012. According to Kujo this is because he was the primary force behind making games at Irem, and the remaining staff wish to focus only on pachislot.</p>"

During the next couple of years they released about ten games, none which were as successful as Kingdom of Kroz. In 1991 <a href=\"/george-broussard/3040-1866/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1866\">George Broussard</a> stepped in as co-owner of the company, and he brought with him some of his previously developed games, such as <a href=\"/pharaohs-tomb/3030-8165/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8165\">Pharaoh's Tomb</a>. But none of his previous games can compare to the game that made this man known, <a href=\"/duke-nukem/3025-164/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-164\">Duke Nukem</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62023/1318997-apogee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1318997\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 159px\" data-ratio=\"0.54716981132075\" data-width=\"159\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62023/1318997-apogee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1318997\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62023/1318997-apogee.png\"></a><figcaption>Apogee Software, Ltd.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Apogee didn't only develop games, they also published them. While publishing their own games they also had deals with other studios, most notably <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id Software</a>. Although Apogee published several classic games for id Software, <a href=\"/commander-keen/3025-100/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-100\">Commander Keen</a> and <a href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\">Wolfenstein</a> <a href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\">3D</a>, the developers severed their ties with Apogee for their 1993 release, <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Apogee's marketing model was different from the major developers, they relied heavily on the <a href=\"/shareware/3015-1324/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1324\">shareware</a> method. Their first games were completely free, asking the customer to pay if he/she enjoyed the game. This proved to be less profitable than they had planed so they developed their own version of the shareware method, by dividing their games into episodes they would release the first one for free, and the customer would order the next ones via mail-order. This marketing model was so successful that it was adopted by other major companies, such as <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a> and <a href=\"/epic-games/3010-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic Games</a>.</p><p style=\"\">As the years went by, Apogee saw that 3D games began catching on and they saw this as an opportunity to create a second developer, 3D Realms. The purpose behind this decision was to let 3D Realms develop 3D games, while Apogee remained a 2D developer. 3D Realms released their first game, the highly successful <a href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\">Duke Nukem 3D</a> in 1996. That same year marked the death of the Apogee name, by the late 90's 2D games was considered old fashion and outdated, and the Apogee name was associated with these kind of games, so they decided to drop the Apogee name and only use 3D Realms. The last game released under the Apogee name is <a href=\"/stargunner/3030-6139/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6139\">Stargunner</a> in 1996.</p><h2>Role as a Publisher and the Legend of Duke Nukem Forever</h2><p style=\"\">After 1998 3D Realms became more of a publisher than a games developer, many unfinished games were outsourced or sold to other studios, including <a href=\"/descent-freespace-the-great-war/3030-10309/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10309\">Descent: Freespace</a> and <a href=\"/prey/3030-16372/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16372\">Prey</a>. Prey was originally developed by 3D Realms, but several years of delay led to the game being outsourced to <a href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-580\">Interplay</a> who released the game in 2006, after being in development for 11 years. 3D Realms also struck a deal with Remedy, to co-produce their new 3rd person-shooter, <a href=\"/max-payne/3030-2414/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2414\">Max Payne</a> and its sequel <a href=\"/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne/3030-3547/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3547\">Max Payne 2.</a> But despite the fact that several of these games were critically acclaimed and sold well, there is one game that overshadows them all.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/duke-nukem-forever/3030-20721/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20721\">Duke Nukem Forever</a> was first publicly announced in April 1997 with a release date set during the summer of 1998, fans of the Duke Nukem series were ecstatic. It was supposed to be based on the <a href=\"/id-tech-2/3015-1917/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1917\">Quake II engine</a> but soon after Epic Games released their <a href=\"/unreal-engine-1/3015-1919/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1919\">Unreal engine</a> and the team decided to make the switch, because the Unreal engine was better at rendering the vast open spaces needed for some of the levels. In mid June 1998 developer <a href=\"/george-broussard/3040-1866/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1866\">George Broussard</a> announced that the game would be severely delayed because of the engine switch, but this was only the first of many delays.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/330/294041-duke_nukem_forever_teaser_screenshot_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-294041\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/330/294041-duke_nukem_forever_teaser_screenshot_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-294041\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/330/294041-duke_nukem_forever_teaser_screenshot_big.jpg\"></a><figcaption>From the 2007 trailer</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">By 2003 the game had retreated to the shadows, only surfacing now and then to release a new screenshot or a teaser trailer, but no news on development progress or release date were announced. It became known that only 18 people were currently working on the game, one former employee stated that the game was far from finished and would definitely not be released any time soon.</p><p style=\"\">In 2007 a new trailer emerged, the first one in six years, when asked when the game would be released Broussard replied, \"When it's done.\"</p><p style=\"\">By 2008 the game were nearing completion but a lack of funding held it back. Having spent more than $20 million of their own money Broussard and Miller went to the publisher, <a href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-450\">Take-Two</a> asking for more, while Take-Two initially agreed to invest $6 million they later lowered the amount to $2.5 million. Broussard refused this offer, and on May 6, 2009 he suspended all development on the project. The final nail in the coffin came only two days later, when the team working on the game were laid off. Development of <a href=\"/duke-nukem-forever/3030-20721/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20721\">Duke Nukem Forever</a> was subsequently handed to <a href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\">Gearbox Software</a>, known for <a href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\">Borderlands</a> among other titles, and released in June 2011 to mostly tepid reviews.</p><p style=\"\">In September 2012, 3D Realms announced they were utilizing crowd sourcing to fund a new game tentatively titled No More Earth.</p><h2>Resurrection</h2><p style=\"\">On March 3rd 2014, Danish investment firm SDN Invest, the part-owner of <a href=\"/interceptor-entertainment/3010-8156/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8156\">Interceptor Entertainment</a>, announced their acquisition of 3D Realms.

    "description": "<h2>Company Brief</h2>New World Computing was a developer and publisher of RPG and strategy games.  Their work was primarily on computer platforms but some of their titles have been ported to early consoles as well.  The company was originally founded in Agoura Hills, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1719\" href=\"/california/3035-1719/\" slug=\"california\">    California</a> in 1984 by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-4721\" href=\"/jon-van-caneghem/3040-4721/\" slug=\"jon-van-caneghem\">     John Van Caneghem</a>, his wife <a data-ref-id=\"3040-22358\" href=\"/michaela-van-caneghem/3040-22358/\" slug=\"michaela-van-caneghem\">     Michaela Van Caneghem</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-12240\" href=\"/mark-caldwell/3040-12240/\" slug=\"mark-caldwell\">     Mark Caldwell</a>.  A few of their titles were published by other companies but the vast majority of their titles were self-published, a practice that was more common in that period (with the exception of everything developed after their acquisition by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-224\" href=\"/the-3do-company/3010-224/\" slug=\"the-3do-company\">   3DO</a> which were all published by that company.)  Their catalog consisted of a number of different titles (many of them one-offs) but they are most famous for the lengthy  Might &amp; Magic series of RPGs (which has 9 titles in the core series and several additional series) and its subsequent turn-based strategy spin-off series, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-687\" href=\"/heroes-of-might-and-magic/3025-687/\" slug=\"heroes-of-might-and-magic\">     Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</a>.<br/><br/>The company met with significant success which led to them being acquired by  NTN Communications (now known as NTN Buzztime, famous for their bar video trivia system) and then in 1996, they were sold to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-224\" href=\"/the-3do-company/3010-224/\" slug=\"the-3do-company\">     The 3DO Company</a> for approximately $13MUS.  The New World Computing imprint was kept and they continued to operate under 3DO's banner as a creatively independent studio.  The 3DO Company began a string of financial difficulties in the years that followed.  Their  3DO console platform was a huge failure and after that, they tried to refocus on software publishing.  Despite the continued success of New World Computing's titles, they were not enough to stem 3DO's losses and on April 15, 2002, it was announced that a large portion of the studio's staff were being laid off.  3DO's fortunes continued to decline and the company entered chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May, 2003.  Unable to secure new funding and unable to find a buyer for the studio, the intellectual property rights to the Might &amp; Magic and Heroes of Might &amp; Magic franchises were sold to Ubisoft for a mere $1.3MUS and the New World Computing studio was dissolved with the rest of The 3DO Company.<br/><br/>Ubisoft has since released three titles with these properties, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15065\" href=\"/dark-messiah-of-might-magic/3030-15065/\" slug=\"dark-messiah-of-might-magic\">     Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14344\" href=\"/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic-elements/3030-14344/\" slug=\"dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic-elements\">     Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic:  Elements</a> (a console adaptation of the previous game with some different content) and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1915\" href=\"/heroes-of-might-and-magic-v/3030-1915/\" slug=\"heroes-of-might-and-magic-v\">     Heroes of Might &amp; Magic V</a>.  These titles have very little to do with the original series they are based on, save sharing the name.<br/><br/>In 2004,<a data-ref-id=\"3040-4721\" href=\"/jon-van-caneghem/3040-4721/\" slug=\"jon-van-caneghem\">  Jon Van Caneghem</a> joined <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3636\" href=\"/ncsoft-corporation/3010-3636/\" slug=\"ncsoft-corporation\">     NCsoft</a> where he worked until 2005.  On September 25, 2006, he announced that he was forming a new company called <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6334\" href=\"/trion-world-network/3010-6334/\" slug=\"trion-world-network\">     Trion World Network</a> which is currently working on several projects, including a new fantasy MMO with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-4721\" href=\"/jon-van-caneghem/3040-4721/\" slug=\"jon-van-caneghem\">  Van Caneghem</a> leading the project."

This was the chip that Nintendo used to prevent unlicensed companies from making working cartridges.  The first of these unlicensed games was released in 1989 and was called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12102\" href=\"/baby-boomer/3030-12102/\" slug=\"baby-boomer\"> Baby Boomer</a>.

The company was based in Villerbanne, outside Lyon, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-197\" href=\"/france/3035-197/\">France</a>. Soon after it was founded, Thomas Schmider joined the company and they started writing programming software. Infogrames started developing family orientated software for the fast developing personal computer market but had also ventured into the video games market. Infogrames quickly established itself as recognized video games developer, albeit in a very new industry by developing and publishing games such as Autoroute Highway and Le Cube Informatique.</p><p style=\"\">Early on in the business Infogrames found is difficult to secure funding to grow its video game division due to the reluctance of investors to invest in such a new, risky and untested market. Infogrames continued to grow slowly and by the end of the 1980s it had acquired several licenses such as the popular comic book <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11421\" href=\"/tintin/3005-11421/\">Tintin</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-978\" href=\"/asterix/3025-978/\">Asterix</a> and Les Tuniques Bleues. It also moved away from the software market and focused solely on developing video games. Infogrames Entertainment's first big success occurred with the release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5569\" href=\"/tintin-on-the-moon/3030-5569/\">Tintin on the Moon</a> which helped drive the companies sales passed FFr 100 million mark (est. $20 million).</p><h3>Early 1990's</h3><p style=\"\">Infogrames quickly began to develop games for new gaming systems currently entering the market such as the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\">SNES</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-3\" href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\">Game Boy</a>. It saw this as a major area of growth for the video games industry as owning a gaming console was much cheaper than a personal computer. However Infogrames continued to develop games for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-17\" href=\"/mac/3045-17/\">Macintosh</a> computers. Its early adoption of the Nintendo gaming platform proved fruitful as its video game sales increased dramatically.</p><p style=\"\">Infogrames started to invest heavily in research and development to keep up with the ever increasing sophistication of computer technology. This lead to better looking games featuring 3D graphics but also increased development cycles for these games. A game which benefited from this program was <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3102\" href=\"/alone-in-the-dark/3030-3102/\">Alone in the Dark</a> which took 2 years produce and was released in 1992. This game became an international success and provided instant recognition for the company. A long run of sequels followed for this franchise.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14982/925704-doom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925704\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.5097749907783\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14982/925704-doom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925704\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14982/925704-doom.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Doom.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Infogrames was publicly floated in 1993, with a listing on the Paris 'Second Marché' Stock Exchange to fuel its growth and ambition to become one of the world top video game developers. This was very successful for Infogrames and shareholders were lining up to buy a stake in the company. 61 million share requests were made for 115,000 shares available. The major shareholders included Chargeurs Group and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1577\" href=\"/philips-media-france/3010-1577/\">Philips Media</a>; a subsidiary for Dutch conglomerate, Phillips. Later that year Infogrames released a line of commercially successful games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23719\" href=\"/asterix/3030-23719/\">Asterix</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\" href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\">Doom</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5088\" href=\"/marco-polo/3030-5088/\">Marco Polo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3970\" href=\"/myst/3030-3970/\">Myst</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In 1994 Infogrames started its international expansion by first creating subsidiaries in major European markets. It created Infogrames Entertainment Benelux in Brussels, Belgium and then aligned with Compagnie Luxembourgeois de Telecommunication (CLT, now RTL group) to from Infogrames Entertainment GmbH, in order to enter the German market. Later than year IESA sold an additional 230,062 shares in the company raising 75,920,460 FF. (est $15 million) By the end of 1994 Infogrames had become the France's largest video game developer beating French rivals <a data-ref-id=\"3010-217\" href=\"/cryo-interactive-entertainment/3010-217/\">Cryo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-82\" href=\"/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/\">Ubisoft</a> but was still small in comparison to international giants such as <a href=\"/\">Electronic Arts.</a></p><h3>1996-2000: Growth through Acquisitions</h3><p style=\"\">Infogrames long term ambition of becoming the world largest video game developer had not diminished and it sought to do so by way of acquisitions. In 1996 it embarked on this acquisition program by purchasing UK based <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6983\" href=\"/ocean-software-ltd/3010-6983/\">Ocean Software Ltd</a>. for $100 million and subsequently remained it Infogrames UK. This acquisition gave Infogrames the opportunity to extend its software development capacity, access to Ocean's huge licensed video game catalog and most importantly entrance to the American market via Ocean's U.S. subsidiary. By the end of 1996, more than 70 percent of Infogrames' sales came from beyond its home country, taping into the global presence of the video game industry, now reaching total combined sales of $4 billion.</p><p style=\"\">The following year Infogrames bought out Philips Media's publishing and distribution business which made IESA, the leading developer, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment software in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-289\" href=\"/europe/3035-289/\">Europe</a>. It also gained presence in the Australian market by purchasing a majority stake in game distributor Ozesoft, renaming it Infogrames Australia. IESA sort to diversify into the multimedia business and jointly formed Game One with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2077\" href=\"/canalmultimedia/3010-2077/\">Canal</a> and launch Europe's first dedicated video game TV channel. It also acquired ABS Multimedia, Arcadia and Swiss Gamecity GmbH. With Infogrames previous acquisitions and its ever growing video game library, annual sales topped 1.4 billion FF ($270 million) by the end of its 1998 fiscal year.</p><p style=\"\">Even with the recent purchases, IESA did not stop with its quest to dominate the video game industry. It sort to procure smaller sized game development companies in an effort to consolidate what was a highly fragmented industry. In 1999 it raised a further 600 million FF (est. $115 million) through share sales and acquired graphics design company <a data-ref-id=\"3010-448\" href=\"/psygnosis-limited/3010-448/\">Psygnosis</a> Paris, Australian <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3409\" href=\"/krome-studios-melbourne/3010-3409/\">Beam Software</a>; renaming it Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd, United Kingdom's <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3\" href=\"/gremlin-interactive-ltd/3010-3/\">Gremlin Interactive</a> and US based <a data-ref-id=\"3010-580\" href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\">Interplay</a> and Acolade Inc.

This acquisition tripled Infogrames workforce cost the company $210 million including GTI's current debt.

GT Interactive was later renamed Infogrames, Inc and became IESA's North American subsidiary. With this acquisition IESA became the second largest video game developer and publisher in the video game industry.</p><p style=\"\">Infogrames continued to expand its business in the multimedia sector by purchasing a 50% stake in Canal Multimedia and entered the expanding mobile telephone market. It continued to purchase more video game companies such a Texas based <a data-ref-id=\"3010-808\" href=\"/paradigm-entertainment-inc/3010-808/\">Paradigm Entertainment</a>, Den-O-Tech and formed a joint venture with Japan's <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\">Hudson Soft Co.

They began the company on the idea that everyone should be able to experience the joy of performing music, even those who may have trouble learning a traditional instrument. They had moderate success with their first few titles, but really hit it big with the introduction of Guitar Hero, which eventually evolved into the Rock Band franchise.</p><p style=\"\">On February 7th, 2011, Harmonix announced layoffs intended to bring the studio \"into alignment with our current product development plans.\" Approximately 12-15% of the 240 employees were laid off.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3>FreQuency</h3><p style=\"\">FreQuency was released on November 20th, 2001 and was Harmonix's first game on the Playstation 2 console. The gameplay of FreQuency revolved around the player guiding a virtual avatar known as FreQ down a note highway in the shape of an octagonal tunnel. There would be musical tracks lining the walls of this tunnel. On these tracks were notes that if the player hit the corresponding key of on their Playstation 2 controller would emit a sound which would combine to form the track. If the player managed to correctly do this for up to two bars of the track, the game would tell the player the track had been captured. The game featured 27 tracks from various artists including some from in-house musician and musical director Kasson Crooker and his band Freezepop who have gone on to be featured in other Harmonix games. The game gave Harmonix critical acclaim and sold enough copies to warrant a sequel. The sequel, Amplitude, was released on March 24th, 2003.</p><h3>Amplitude</h3><p style=\"\">Released on the back of FreQuency's success, <a href=\"/amplitude/3030-1420/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1420\">Amplitude</a> was released exclusively to the Playstation 2 in March 2003 a year and a half after FreQuency. Using FreQuency's successful formula it added new features and better graphics to make what many believe to be a legitimate update from FreQuency. It contained 26 songs which was actually 1 less than its predecessor. A rare occurrence in the music game genre nowadays as every game tries to add more songs than the one before. It included a remix mode in a similar style to the one featured in FreQuency giving the player the ability to customize songs to their own liking. The game was also well received by the gaming press getting high scores on websites such as Gamespot and IGN. The sucess of both Amplitude and FreQuency gave Harmonix the chance to team up with publisher <a href=\"/redoctane-inc/3010-3468/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3468\">Red Octane</a> to create the Guitar Hero series.</p><h3>Guitar Hero (series)</h3><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-289\">Guitar Hero</a> franchise first appeared on store shelves in 2005 with the release of the first game in the series, <a href=\"/guitar-hero/3030-6311/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6311\">Guitar Hero</a> for the Playstation 2. Guitar Hero took the ideas showed in FreQuency and Amplitude of a note highway, but reduced the number of tracks to just one and added the use of a guitar shaped controller that came bundled with the game. This controller had 5 colored buttons on the guitar in place of frets which acted like the buttons on a PlayStation 2 controller and a strum bar which was used like strings and that had to be strummed every time a note was played. Guitar Hero featured 47 songs on the disc. Most of which were cover versions of rock songs. Guitar Hero sold well. Eventually selling 1.53 million copies and making $45 million dollars. Its success led to the cultural phenomenon that Guitar Hero is today, as well as spawning many sequels. Sequels like <a href=\"/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/3030-4031/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4031\">Guitar Hero 3</a>, which made $1 billion dollars being the first video game to ever do so. When their contract with Red Octane ended in 2006 they were purchased by Viacom, the parent company of MTV Games, as well as the MTV network channels, who would go on to publish Harmonix's future titles under their own MTV Games label with distribution &amp; marketing being handled by EA. Red Octane was purchased by <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a> at about the same time that Harmonix was sold to Viacom thereby severing all ties between the two companies. The Guitar Hero series was handed off to Activision subsidiary studio <a href=\"/neversoft-entertainment/3010-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1442\">Neversoft</a> for future development. Harmonix would go on to start an all new franchise that has arguably surpassed anything that has come before it in the music / rhythm category, <a href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-567\">Rock Band</a>.</p><h3>Rock Band (series)</h3><p style=\"\">Upon being acquired by MTV games they began work on a new muic game title known as <a href=\"/rock-band/3030-9860/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9860\">Rock Band</a>, which would take the primary gameplay from Guitar Hero and add two extra instruments to the game, a 4 pad drum kit and a microphone to give the full band feel. Released on November 20th, 2007 (the same day 6 years earlier that FreQuency was released) it was like its now rival creation Guitar Hero and had commercial and critical success selling over 4 million units and creating $600 million dollars in revenue. One of the key aspects of its success was its Music Store which was a feature on the menu of the game that took you to an <a href=\"/itunes-store/3015-2380/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2380\">iTunes</a> like interface where you could purchase additional songs in either single form, a track pack or a whole album. This enabled some people to instead of having a setlist of 58 songs to grow their library into the hundreds. On September 14th, 2008, <a href=\"/rock-band-2/3030-20714/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20714\">Rock Band 2</a> was released. The game sold more than 1.7 million copies before the end of the year. As of November 25th, 2009 there were over 1,000 songs available for download in the Rock Band Store. Harmonix also released two band-specific games, <a href=\"/the-beatles-rock-band/3030-24667/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24667\">The Beatles: Rock Band</a> and <a href=\"/green-day-rock-band/3030-29439/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29439\">Green Day: Rock Band</a>. They also released <a href=\"/lego-rock-band/3030-25765/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25765\">Lego: Rock Band</a>, a version of the game that featured more kid-friendly music. On October 26th 2010, Harmonix released <a href=\"/rock-band-3/3030-27919/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27919\">Rock Band 3</a>, which took the tried and true Rock Band formula and added support for a keyboard peripheral. As of February 2011, there are over 2,500 different songs available to play in Rock Band, with new tracks still being added every week.</p><h3>Dance Central (series)</h3><p style=\"\">Harmonix moved on from the Rock Band franchise to develop a dancing game series for the Xbox 360, for use only with the <a href=\"../../kinect/92-3249/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kinect</a> peripheral. The game is able to scan your body and register the dance moves you are performing.

Many regard the Tomb Raider films as the better of a long line of terrible game-to-movie adaptations.</p><p style=\"\">Much like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-267\" href=\"/tomb-raider/3025-267/\">Tomb Raider</a> before it, the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-306\" href=\"/hitman/3025-306/\">Hitman</a> franchise has been popular with critics and also spawned a feature film. The original Hitman, entitled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6709\" href=\"/hitman-codename-47/3030-6709/\">Hitman: Codename 47</a> was released in the year 2000, and was dismissed by both gamers and critics due to technical glitches and an underwhelming performance. The sequel, dubbed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7004\" href=\"/hitman-2-silent-assassin/3030-7004/\">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a> was well received and marked the first successful entry into the series. There were two more sequels after that, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6601\" href=\"/hitman-contracts/3030-6601/\">Hitman: Contracts</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11004\" href=\"/hitman-blood-money/3030-11004/\">Hitman: Blood Money</a>, both of which were large successes and well received. A film version of the game was released in theatres in the fall of 2007, starring former Deadwood star Timothy Olyphant. The film was poorly received by critics and had a relatively poor showing at the box office, and eventually fell off the radar.</p><h2><b>Review Controversy</b></h2><p style=\"\">While many publishers have been implicated in meddling with the press to obtain good review scores and the possible sales boost that can come from that, Eidos in particular has received much criticism over the years for their interference with the critical process. Two of their more publicized controversies are described below.</p><h3>Kane &amp; Lynch and Gamespot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1817/1481862-kane_lynch_gamespot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1481862\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 463px\" data-ratio=\"0.60691144708423\" data-width=\"463\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1817/1481862-kane_lynch_gamespot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1481862\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1817/1481862-kane_lynch_gamespot.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\"Did you happen to see that our readers can skin the entire site with Kane, Lynch or with Kane AND Lynch together? Did you see how they can cut their own riveting Kane &amp; Lynch trailers?\"</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps their most infamous review controversy, in November 2007, Eidos was implicated in being involved in the firing of <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89712\" href=\"/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/\">Jeff Gerstmann</a>, former Editorial Director of CNET's Gamespot. Gerstmann gave Eidos' major release for that fall, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3562\" href=\"/io-interactive/3010-3562/\">IO Interactive</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19874\" href=\"/kane-lynch-dead-men/3030-19874/\">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men</a>, a 6.0 out of 10. Shortly following, he was let go from his Gamespot position. Insider sources claimed that Gerstmann had been fired for giving the game a low score after Eidos complained to CNET; these claims were corroborated by a massive advertising campaign Eidos had been running with Gamespot--a campaign that skinned the front page of the website with Kane and Lynch imagery and allowed users to edit their own trailers--that promptly ended following the publishing of the review, the text of the review being edited and the video review for the game being pulled from the site shortly after Gerstmann's departure, and the mass exodus of other key staff members in the months following. It was eventually revealed that Eidos had indeed complained to CNET and threatened to pull advertising, but ultimately backed down and had no direct involvement in Gerstmann's firing. Eidos' complaint was one of a handful of complaints from several games publishers over lower-than-average scores for some games during Q4 of 2007; the complaint from Eidos was ultimately the straw that broke the camel's back that led to the CNET administration, whom had seen huge turnover at the time and was generally inexperienced with running a gaming website, losing confidence in Gerstmann and deciding to distance themselves from his editorial direction.</p><h3><b>Tomb Radar</b></h3><p style=\"\">A year after being accused of being one of the primary forces behind Jeff Gerstmann's dismissal, Eidos was again accused of using advertising dollars to buy favorable coverage, this time with British-based Future Publishing. In the week leading up to the game's release, GamesRadar, Future's flagship online gaming portal, began a campaign that saw a Tomb Raider-related article published every day in honor of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20694\" href=\"/tomb-raider-underworld/3030-20694/\">Tomb Raider Underworld</a>, culminating in the website changing its name to \"Tomb Radar\" for a day. Future's James Binn lauded the campaign, stating:</p><blockquote><p style=\"\">“Tomb Raider: Underworld is a great game, well worth the 9/10 scores it is picking up across gaming websites and magazines. Getting the message out there on launch day is essential in the games market and this takeover gives Eidos unprecedented cut through.”</p></blockquote><p style=\"\">On the heels of the Tomb Radar name change, Gamespot UK's Guy Cooker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/guycocker/status/1013270608\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted to his Twitter</a> that Eidos had asked any publication scoring the game lower than an 8.0 to hold the review until the following Monday. Commenting on the scandal, a representative from Eidos' PR firm stated (in a statement that was later retracted):</p><blockquote><p style=\"\">“We’re trying to get the Metacritic rating to be high, and the brand manager in the US that’s handling all of Tomb Raider has asked that we just manage the scores before the game is out, really, just to ensure that we don’t put people off buying the game, basically.”</p></blockquote><p style=\"\">Ironically, PC Gamer UK--a fellow Future publication whose <i>Tomb Raider: Underworld</i> review was repurposed for Games Radar--thought slightly less of the game than the \"across the board\" 9/10 scores Binn had noted, scoring it an 86%. However, when they republishing the review for their site, GamesRadar changed the score to a 9 in accordance with their ten-point scale.</p><p style=\"\">Amusingly, Future did not buy domain rights for tombradar.com during the campaign. The domain was purchased by an anonymous third-party, who used the site to lambast the GamesRadar campaign using many of the above quotes. The site has since been taken down.</p><h2>Purchase By Square Enix</h2><p style=\"\">In February 2009, word came out that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\">Square Enix Holdings Co. Ltd.</a> had come to an agreement to purchase the financially struggling Eidos for roughly $120 million. Throughout the remainder of February and March, support was gained by many shareholders, including <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4405\" href=\"/warner-bros-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-4405/\">Warner Bros</a>., for the purchase.</p><p style=\"\">On March 30, 2009, at an emergency meeting of shareholders, the terms set forth by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\">Square Enix</a> were agreed upon by an overwhelming majority.</p><p style=\"\">On April 21st, Eidos stock was delisted, and on the following day, Eidos became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square Enix Holdings Co. Ltd. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\">Square Enix</a> president Yoichi Wada has stated that Eidos will continue to run as a separate entity under the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\">Square Enix</a> banner, much the same way that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-135\" href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135/\">Taito</a> is.</p><h2>Evolution Into SQUARE ENIX EUROPE</h2><p style=\"\">As of July 7, 2009, the use of the Eidos name for titles published by the company was discontinued, and subsequent Eidos-developed games have been published under the Square Enix label. Eidos CEO <a data-ref-id=\"3040-70981\" href=\"/phil-rogers/3040-70981/\">Phil Rogers</a> was appointed the head of the newly reformed Square Enix Europe, and placed in charge of publishing all of Eidos and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\">Square Enix</a> titles in Europe.</p><p style=\"\">The Eidos name has lived on with the internal studios that were using the moniker at the time of Eidos' merger with Square Enix, such as with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21358\" href=\"/deus-ex-human-revolution/3030-21358/\">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> developers <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6462\" href=\"/eidos-studios-montreal/3010-6462/\">Eidos Montréal</a>.</p>"

    "description": "<p style=\"\">Cauldron was founded in 1996 in Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak Republic, where it resides today. They employ approximately 60 people at present, and were the first Slovakian or Czech game developers to successfully sell a product outside the two countries.<br/><br/>The first game from their offices was \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-14774\" href=\"/quadrax/3030-14774/\" slug=\"quadrax\">Quadrax</a>\". Finished in 1996, this game was originally made for the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-938\" href=\"/sinclair-research-ltd/3010-938/\" slug=\"sinclair-research-ltd\">ZX Spectrum</a>, but promptly ported to <span>PC</span>. It is a two dimensional puzzle game that consists of 100 levels which require the user to utilize the the ability to switch control between two on-screen characters in order to navigate the puzzle. It is supposedly still the most popular puzzle game in that region.<br/><br/><br/>In 1997, the Czech version of \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-3761\" href=\"/spellcross/3030-3761/\" slug=\"spellcross\">Spellcross</a>\" was finished. However, it was improved and edited a year later for it's English release. The game, as well as it's \"mist\" engine was welcomed with positive reviews. The user plays the role of a commander for the fictional faction, \"The Alliance\", a group using modern military might to fight creatures that utilize magic. The game is divided into two parts; the first is strategic, where the player makes large scale troop movement decisions and manages resources and finances, and the second is tactical, where the player uses military units in turn based combat. Spellcross was the first game from either Slovakia or the Czech republic to be sold outside those countries. It is also supposedly still very popular in those countries.<br/><br/>Cauldron released another turn-based strategy game in 2000 called \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-4942\" href=\"/battle-isle-the-andosia-war/3030-4942/\" slug=\"battle-isle-the-andosia-war\">Battle Isle: The Andosia War</a>\".<br/><br/>In 2001, Cauldron began work on one of their best known efforts, the first person shooter, \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-5563\" href=\"/chaser/3030-5563/\" slug=\"chaser\">Chaser</a>\". The user assumes the role of \"John Chaser\" on a quest through Earth and Mars to regain his memory. Chaser was released in 2003 to great critical acclaim. It's best known for it's visuals and the ability to host multiplayer matches of up to 128 players in such classic modes as \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">Capture the Flag</a>\" and \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">Deathmatch</a>\". It used Cauldron's new in-house \"CloakNT\" engine, which every Cauldron FPS to date uses. Chaser was also their most successful effort in North America.<br/><br/>In 2004 they released \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-533\" href=\"/conan/3030-533/\" slug=\"conan\">Conan</a>\", based on Robert E. Howard's \"Conan: The Barbarian\". This was Cauldron's first true multiplatform game.<br/><br/>In 2005, \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-5263\" href=\"/knights-of-the-temple-ii/3030-5263/\" slug=\"knights-of-the-temple-ii\">Knights of the Temple II</a>\" was finished. It was an open world 3rd person action adventure game with interactive dialogue, alternate endings and multiplayer.<br/><br/>Cauldron also finished \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-7891\" href=\"/gene-troopers/3030-7891/\" slug=\"gene-troopers\">Gene Troopers</a>\" in 2005. It is a FPS set in the future where genetic material is now an important strategic resource, and a faction called \"the Gene Troopers\" seeks to collect more and more genetic material to further their super soldier creation program.<br/><br/>In 2006 Cauldron released \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-3522\" href=\"/civil-war-a-nation-divided/3030-3522/\" slug=\"civil-war-a-nation-divided\">Civil War: A Nation Divided</a>\". This game reenacts 12 different battles from the American civil war.<br/><br/>In 2007 Cauldron released \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-20980\" href=\"/the-history-channel-battle-for-the-pacific/3030-20980/\" slug=\"the-history-channel-battle-for-the-pacific\">Battle for the Pacific</a>\", which has the player fighting on the front lines in the most crucial battles of the pacific front of WWII.<br/><br/>Also released in 2007 was the third installment in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-348\" href=\"/soldier-of-fortune/3025-348/\" slug=\"soldier-of-fortune\">Soldier of Fortune </a>series, \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-8632\" href=\"/soldier-of-fortune-payback/3030-8632/\" slug=\"soldier-of-fortune-payback\">Soldier of Fortune: Payback</a>\". While visually proficient, the game was critically panned. It's faults lied largely in the short development time, a supposed result of the lack of funding on Activision's part.<br/><br/>In 2008, Cauldron released both \"<span>Civil War: Secret Missions</span>\" and \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-23907\" href=\"/secret-service/3030-23907/\" slug=\"secret-service\">Secret Service</a>\". Secret Missions is a fallow up to their previous Civil War game, which has you engage in real historical missions to sabotage either side of the conflict. Secret Service is a game in which the user assumes the role of a secret service agent, who is tasked with protecting political figures and other high value assets, including the United States president.</p>"

The increase in processing power also brought about a change in direction for Sensible Software with two of their most original products; Mega-Lo-Mania and Wizkid. The former was a well-received simulation of a God’s struggle for dominance, and the latter was a platformer which continued the narrative of their earlier hit, Wizball.</p><h2>Sensible Soccer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5610/233425-swos_xbla_concept.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-233425\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7609561752988\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5610/233425-swos_xbla_concept.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-233425\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5610/233425-swos_xbla_concept.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5610/233425-swos_xbla_concept.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Xbox live verson</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/sensible-world-of-soccer/3030-19165/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19165\">Sensible Soccer</a> marked the return to sports for the company and was released to a roar of critical acclaim.

Detractors also claimed the game glorified warfare, when in truth it was a satire of those that engaged in such conflict. Despite such negative coverage, the game was a success; but it would be the company's last.</p><h3>End of an Era</h3><p style=\"\">Sensible’s new IP’s beyond this point, such as the the disappointing Sensible Golf, never got anywhere near the heights of their golden period between 1987 and 1995 as the company expanded in numbers and grappled with 3D for the first time. They also explored new concepts such as the game Sex ‘n’ Drugs ‘n’ Rock ‘n’ Roll (originally a joke game idea called \"Drugged out Hippy\" invented by Chris and Jon during their rock days.) This game was signed up by Warner Interactive for a 7 figure sum in 1995 but support for the project was pulled due to the game’s controversial themes, coding problems and a change of control when Warner was sold to GT Software.</p><h3>Codemasters</h3><p style=\"\">At this point, Sensible’s owners were looking for a way to bow out gracefully, and their wish was granted when veteran UK publisher Codemasters bought them out in 1999. Jon Hare has maintained a close working relationship with Codemasters ever since, designing many games for them including updates of Sensible Soccer for the PlayStation, Cannon Fodder for the Gameboy Color, and a recently updated Sensible World of Soccer for Xbox Live Arcade.</p>"

The company has a very close working relationship with the <a href=\"/nintendo-ead/3010-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-463\"> Nintendo EAD</a> division and has collaborated with them extensively on many games across several generations of Nintendo platforms including the <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\"> Super Smash Bros</a>. series. HAL laboratory games are popularly praised for their simple intuitive controls and addictive play.</p><h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Founded on February 21, 1980 in Tokyo, Japan, HAL Laboratory has created games for many consoles and computers, including the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\"> Commodore 64</a>, <a href=\"/msx/3045-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\"> MSX</a>, <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\"> NES</a>, <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\"> SNES</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\"> Nintendo 64</a>, <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\"> GameCube</a>, <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\"> Wii</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\"> Nintendo DS</a> and <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\"> 3DS.</a> Their name is a reference to the HAL 9000 computer in from the famous science fiction novel (and film) <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13774/489893-515px_iwata_e3_2006_crop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-489893\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1631067961165\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13774/489893-515px_iwata_e3_2006_crop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-489893\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13774/489893-515px_iwata_e3_2006_crop.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Satoru Iwata, former president of Nintendo and ex-HAL employee</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The company was originally started by a department store manager and a group of enthusiast employees, now-famous industry icons <a href=\"/satoru-iwata/3040-46955/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-46955\"> Satoru Iwata</a> and Masahito Tanimura among them. As Iwata recalls in an interview, \"We became friends, formed a club, and soon rented an apartment in the Akihabara district of Tokyo where we began designing our own games. We worked until midnight or later every night, and that group of friends is what became the company known as HAL today.\" It was this enthusiast passion that allowed HAL to grow from a basement club to the bastion of quality family gaming that it is today.</p><p style=\"\">Although the company was made up of hardcore enthusiasts, it wasn't video games that HAL first developed. Instead, they worked on a few peripherals before getting to their real dream of developing games. They first made a scanner and a trackball for the MSX system. Despite the fact that these weren't actually games, the peripherals proved successful and HAL was quickly propelled into the meat of game development, with their first official release being <a href=\"/eggerland-mystery/3030-17773/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17773\"> Eggerland</a> for the MSX in 1985. This would serve as the basis for their Lolo games.</p><p style=\"\">The company first rose to prominence with Western audiences in 1989 with the release of its surprise hit <a href=\"/adventures-of-lolo/3025-781/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-781\"> Lolo</a> games for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\"> Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. The Lolo series would serve as an aesthetic and game design template for future HAL games, the most notable of these being their signature <a href=\"/kirby/3025-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-420\"> Kirby franchise</a> which was created immediately after the Lolo games had their run. The <a href=\"/kirby/3005-726/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-726\"> Kirby</a> character has become one of Nintendo's best known mascots and has appeared in over twenty-five games as of 2011.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1889741-krtdl5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889741\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56388206388206\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1889741-krtdl5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889741\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1889741-krtdl5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Return to Dreamland is the latest in HAL's hugely successful Kirby franchise</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Before they could develop Kirby, though, HAL had to prove themselves to Nintendo. Not always a subsidiary of Nintendo's, HAL took contracts from numerous different companies and worked on many different platforms at the start of their life cycle. When they began to hear rumors that Nintendo was hard at work developing a home console that would be capable of stunning new graphics (this console would turn out to be the NES, or Famicom in Japan) they rushed to secure a contract to develop for the system. Instead of allowing them to do their own original game, however, Nintendo hired them to fix one of theirs that had fallen far behind schedule. Thus was NES Pinball born. After the surprise success of this once-broken game, HAL was allowed much more creative freedom, and went on to create both the Kirby and Earthbound series, both of which received massive critical acclaim over their life cycles.</p><p style=\"\">Since then the studio has found even greater fame creating and developing Nintendo's extremely popular Super Smash Bros series, a few games of the world famous <a href=\"/pokemon/3025-452/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\"> Pokemon</a> series and the cult hit <a href=\"/earthbound/3025-170/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-170\"> Mother</a> series (known in America as <a href=\"/earthbound/3025-170/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-170\"> Earthbound</a>). In 2011 HAL released their first augmented reality game, <a href=\"/face-raiders/3030-34610/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34610\"> Face Raiders</a>, for the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p style=\"\">HAL Laboratory is also notable for its talent. <a href=\"/satoru-iwata/3040-46955/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-46955\"> Satoru Iwata</a>, former president of Nintendo, used to be the president of HAL Laboratory. Before founding <a href=\"/sora/3010-6301/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6301\"> Sora, Ltd.</a>, <a href=\"/masahiro-sakurai/3040-66996/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-66996\"> Masahiro Sakurai</a> (creator of Kirby and Super Smash Bros.) worked at HAL Laboratory.</p><h2>Development Policies</h2><p style=\"\">HAL Laboratories took on its name from the AI in Kubrick's <i>2001: A Space Odyssey.</i> It is speculated that they chose the name because the film, which emphasizes the cold and calculating nature of technology, inspired them to make their company the warm, approachable face of video game technology that they are today. Although mere speculation, titles such as <i>Kirby's Epic Yarn</i> go a long way towards validating this policy.</p><p style=\"\">Further evidence of this is shown in their work mantras. Much like <a href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\"> Valve</a> and <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\"> id</a>, HAL takes a \"when it's done\" approach to releasing their games, emphasizing within the company the full completion of a product before it is released to store shelves.</p><p style=\"\">HAL also encourages its employees to play games together socially as a way of bringing the team together. In addition to allowing team members to bond with one another, this also keeps HAL abreast of all the current trends in game design, ensuring that their products remain competitive even in such a crowded market. For HAL, it is this mixture of developing and playing that leads to such magical success. It is important to maintain and nurture employee's passion for the industry that they inhabit, and for HAL, this method has been a success.</p><h2>Miscellany</h2><ul><li>HAL Laboratory, Inc was situated within Pokémon Blue and Red in Celadon city as an easter egg.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Bethesda Softworks is a development studio located in Rockville, Maryland. Bethesda specializes in role-playing games, and is considered by many to be one of the leading Western RPG developers along with <a href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-98\">Bioware</a>. Bethesda has released many well-received games like <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33394\">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> and <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a>. Bethesda bought the license to create Fallout games from Interplay in 2004 for one-million USD in cash. They then announced that they were working on their first installment in the <a href=\"/fallout/3025-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-183\">Fallout</a> franchise in 2007. Other licenses owned by Bethesda include the license for non-MMO <a href=\"/star-trek/3025-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-330\">Star Trek</a> games. Bethesda is currently owned by ZeniMax Media Inc. who has provided Bethesda with enough funds to publish Fallout 3 on its own, and will likely be publishing its own games from here on out.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1718750-teamphoto_new_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1718750\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.62864583333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1718750-teamphoto_new_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1718750\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1718750-teamphoto_new_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bethesda Team (Skyrim)</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Bethesda Softworks was founded in 1985 by Christopher Weaver in Bethesda, Maryland. The company relocated to its current location of Rockville, Maryland in 1990. Bethesda's first title was a sports simulation game called Gridiron!, released in 1986. From 1986 to 1992 the company developed a number of games, including several <a href=\"/the-terminator/3030-10713/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10713\">Terminator</a> titles and many sports simulator games. In 1993 Bethesda released the first game in what is likely its most recognizable franchise, <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-arena/3030-7513/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7513\">The Elder Scrolls: Arena</a>. Arena is a first person action RPG that put a lot of focus on side quests and featured an open ended world called, <a href=\"/tamriel/3035-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-92\">Tamriel</a>. Company founder Christopher Weaver is recognized as the principal force behind the creation of the game. The Elder Scrolls: Arena was developed for the computer and released via CD-ROM, and Floppy disc. Bethesda released its second title in The Elder Scrolls series in 1996, called <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-daggerfall/3030-1129/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1129\">The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</a>, for the computer.</p><h3>ZeniMax Acquisition</h3><p style=\"\">In 1999, Bethesda Softworks was acquired by ZeniMax Media Inc., a company founded by Bethesda Softworks founder, Christopher Weaver and current ZeniMax Media Inc. CEO, Robert A. Altman. From 1999 to 2001, Bethesda developed and published mainly sports and racing titles like, NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing, Skip Barber Racing, PBA Bowling 2001, IHRA Motorsports, as well as an adventure game, Sea Dogs, and an action game, Echelon. In 2002, Bethesda released the third title in The Elder Scrolls series, <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/3030-17367/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17367\">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>, for Windows <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> and <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a>. The game was, at the time, one of Bethesda's most successful titles, selling over four million copies and winning numerous awards. Two expansion packs were released for the game, <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iii-tribunal/3030-17949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17949\">The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal</a> in 2002, and <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iii-bloodmoon/3030-8121/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8121\">The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon</a> in 2003. In 2006, <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> was released (published by <a href=\"/2k-games/3010-360/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-360\">2K Games</a>), receiving the best reviews, in average, of any The Elder Scrolls games, and selling over three million copies as of January 18, 2007. Bethesda developed and published its latest title, <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1292644-infernal_citynew2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1292644\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 258px\" data-ratio=\"0.17829457364341\" data-width=\"258\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:17.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1292644-infernal_citynew2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1292644\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1292644-infernal_citynew2.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">In 2004, Bethesda Softworks bought the rights to the Fallout IP from <a href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-580\">Interplay Entertainment</a>, and started development on Fallout 3 the same year. The Executive Producer for the game was <a href=\"/todd-howard/3040-57173/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-57173\">Todd Howard</a>, who was involved, in different capacities, in all of the principal titles of The Elder Scroll series, and was Project Lead for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and executive producer for the development of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Fallout 3 was released, in North America on October 28, 2008, for the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. The game has become Bethesda's best selling game to date, shipping 4.7 million copies of the game internationally, for the first week, and producing a profit of $300 million. In 2009, the company released a staggering five pieces of Fallout 3 DLC (Downloadable Content) for the Xbox 360, PS3 and the PC. At QuakeCon 2010 Todd Howard revealed that Bethesda is currently working on two projects. The first was revealed to be <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33394\">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> on December 11, 2010 at the <a href=\"/spike-video-game-awards/3015-5557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5557\">Spike VGAs</a> with a projected release date of November 11, 2011. The second game has yet to be revealed, but is in preproduction.</p><h2>Headquarters</h2><p style=\"\">The Bethesda Softworks headquarters--located in Rockville, Maryland--is quite an extensive building. Video game publication Game Informer took a trip to the headquarters to shoot a behind the scene video for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Todd Howard revealed the large exercise room (where several members of the team go to practice martial arts) as well as large kitchen where the staff is served breakfast, lunch, and even dinner each day.</p><h2>Bethesda Blog &amp; Podcast</h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"http://bethblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bethblog.com</a> is an unofficial blog run by Bethesda's employees.

In 2004, ASCII and all of its subsidaries were purchased by Kadokawa Holdings.

When the company was first established they were known as JAM and their first official game was Ski Crazed for the Apple II which was made when Andy and Jason were only 16. By the Nineties the company had changed their name to Naughty Dog and progressed to creating <a href=\"/way-of-the-warrior/3030-14900/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14900\">Way of the Warrior</a> for the 3DO. Arguably their most renowned property, the <a href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3025-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-116\">Crash Bandicoot</a> series, came about when <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\">Sonic The Hedgehog 2</a> producer <a href=\"/mark-cerny/3040-18965/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-18965\">Mark Cerny</a> suggested the company focus on a character based platform game for the newly revealed Playstation console. The Crash series, consisting of 4 games went on to sell over 22 million copies combined on the Playstation, making Naughty Dog the most successful developer in the US for that generation.</p><h3>The PS2 Generation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2009/190739-newssuggest_xx832283.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190739\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2244897959184\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2009/190739-newssuggest_xx832283.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190739\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2009/190739-newssuggest_xx832283.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2009/190739-newssuggest_xx832283.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jak and Daxter</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">With the next Playstation console Naughty Dog decided to start afresh with a new series, <a href=\"/jak-daxter/3025-366/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-366\">Jak &amp; Daxter</a>, and to use the increased power of the console to give the game a larger, open world scope and a greater degree of fidelity and detail. Almost a year before completion of the first <a href=\"/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy/3030-14623/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14623\">Jak &amp; Daxter</a> game, in January 2001 it was announced that Naughty Dog was becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony. As with the Crash series Naughty Dog released 4 games in the main series on the PS2 (as well as a <a href=\"/daxter/3030-14604/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14604\">Daxter</a> only spin off on the PSP) and each sold well and were generally received positively by gamers. Unlike Crash however, it has been strongly hinted that we will see Jak &amp; Daxter return on the current generation of consoles, namely the PS3. In 2004, co-founder Jason Rubin left the company to focus on a comic book project.</p><h3>The PS3 Generation</h3><h4>Uncharted</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1186142-0drake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186142\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2955465587045\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1186142-0drake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186142\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34651/1186142-0drake.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34651/1186142-0drake.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nathan Drake</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">With the bump up in technology again afforded by the new generation of consoles Naughty Dog decided to take another step forward graphically, this time creating a series based in the real world. <a href=\"/uncharted-drakes-fortune/3030-13992/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13992\">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a> debuted at E3 2006 and was initially criticized for looking similar to the <a href=\"/tomb-raider/3025-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-267\">Tomb Raider series</a>. When the game was released it was received positively by critics and eventually sold over 2 million copies. The sequel <a href=\"/uncharted-2-among-thieves/3030-22420/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22420\">Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</a> was released in 2009 and received universal praise. The development team at Naughty Dog quickly went into working off their success from Uncharted 2 and refine it with more polish and technology. In the fall of 2011, they released <a href=\"/uncharted-3-drakes-deception/3030-32982/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32982\">Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception</a>.</p><h4>The Last of Us</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/2079847-6484069899_39fe8d2509_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079847\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/2079847-6484069899_39fe8d2509_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079847\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/2079847-6484069899_39fe8d2509_b.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/2079847-6484069899_39fe8d2509_b.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Last of Us (2012)</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After the release of the third in the Uncharted series, Naughty Dog had put the story of Nathan Drake on hold to begin a game called <a href=\"/the-last-of-us/3030-36989/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36989\">The Last of Us</a>. The trailer was debuted at the 2011 SPIKE TV Video Game Awards. The game features the characters <a href=\"/joel/3005-21586/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21586\">Joel</a> and <a href=\"/ellie/3005-21585/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21585\">Ellie</a> travelling across a post-apocalyptic United States.  The game was released in June 2013 to universal acclaim. A movie adaptation is currently in the works. </p><h3>Relationship With Insomniac</h3><p style=\"\">Naughty Dog has a strong working relationship with developer <a href=\"/insomniac-games/3010-1379/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1379\">Insomniac Games</a>, originating from their history of working in the same building on the Universal Studios backlot. Even their output shares a close resemblance, <a href=\"/spyro-the-dragon/3030-7836/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7836\">Spyro the Dragon</a> and <a href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3030-7380/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7380\">Crash Bandicoot</a>, <a href=\"/ratchet-clank/3030-18309/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18309\">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and <a href=\"/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy/3030-14623/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14623\">Jak &amp; Daxter</a>, even the move to realism taken with <a href=\"/resistance-fall-of-man/3030-9741/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9741\">Resistance</a> and <a href=\"/uncharted-drakes-fortune/3030-13992/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13992\">Uncharted</a>. Indeed the developers have stated that they are able to share technology and development knowledge to mutually improve the user experience. One important distinction is that while Naughty Dog is owned by <a href=\"/sony-corporation/3010-3223/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony</a>, Insomniac Games are fully independent but choose to develop only on the Sony platforms.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>ICE Team</h2><p style=\"\">Naughty Dog is home to a Sony World Wide Studios central technology group called the ICE Team.

    "description": "<p style=\"\">Techland began as a Polish distributor in 1991, originally translating and dealing educational software. Games were produced a few years later, when the company stared to developed their own products, and publish those made by other developers. Speedway Manager was the first game made by the internal studio, which consisted of only one person at the time. Without much success, the company continued to produce games, mostly mediocre family software.</p><p style=\"\">The year 2000 was a breakthrough for Techland, marked by the release of <a href=\"/crime-cities/3030-8398/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8398\">Crime Cities</a>, a highly praised action game set in the future. It was also their first game to be released outside <a href=\"/poland/3035-1722/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1722\">Poland</a>. Then, in 2003, Techland released <a href=\"/chrome/3030-15444/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15444\">Chrome</a> - a futuristic shooter made with their own game-engine, entitled <a href=\"/chrome-engine-5/3015-7119/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7119\">Chrome Engine</a>. This engine became a base for almost all future games made by the Polish company.</p><p style=\"\">A period of stagnation was once again disrupted in 2006, with <a href=\"/call-of-juarez/3030-21191/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21191\">Call of Juarez</a>. Not only was it the first game ever to use <a href=\"/directx/3015-5193/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5193\">DirectX 10</a>, but it was also the first Polish game to be released for <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>. 1.5 million copies of the games were sold, and this huge intake of money allowed Techland to hire more developers. In the following years, the company also started a copy of well-known aggregates, called BazaRecenzji. This project was aimed at Polish users, but the website was eventually closed in 2011.</p><p style=\"\">In 2009, Techland released a prequel to Call of Juarez, entitled <a href=\"/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/3030-25066/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25066\">Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</a>. It was the first Polish title to be released simultaneously for <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>. However, Techland was already thinking about something bigger - <a href=\"/dead-island/3030-21534/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21534\">Dead Island</a>. This games was originally set to debut in 2008, but was delayed multiple times. Development was taking more and more resources, and games such as <a href=\"/chrome-2/3030-21535/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21535\">Chrome 2</a> and <a href=\"/warhound/3030-21524/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21524\">Warhound</a> were suspended. Finally, in September 2011 <a href=\"/dead-island/3030-21534/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21534\">Dead Island</a> was released, followed by a big marketing campaign with the infamously misleading trailer made by Axis Productions. Despite many bugs, the game was well received and eventually shipped 4 million copies.</p>"

In the mid 90's, when Sony stormed the gaming world with the original <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>, they formed a studio in <a href=\"/san-diego/3035-1345/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1345\">San Diego</a> called Sony Interactive Studios America. This studio was tasked with developing a PC role-playing game helmed by <a href=\"/john-smedley/3040-3854/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3854\">John Smedley</a>. Development on this new project began in March 1996 with <a href=\"/brad-mcquaid/3040-3818/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3818\">Brad McQuaid</a> as lead programmer and designer.</p><p style=\"\">In November 1997, the studio released their first title, <a href=\"/tanarus/3030-22291/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22291\">Tanarus</a>, an online tank battle game from a first-person perspective. Development on their ambitious online RPG continued concurrently. In April 1998, Sony merged several studios (SISA, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Sony Online Ventures) and renamed the group <a href=\"/989-studios/3010-6399/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6399\">989 Studios</a>. But by the end of the year, 989 Studios focus was more on creating games for the booming PlayStation console, not PC games that had been SISA's primary forte. So, the part of the studio that continued work on their massively multiplayer online role-playing game renamed themselves <a href=\"/verant-interactive/3010-6577/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6577\">Verant Interactive</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/625406-everquest_box_art_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625406\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1867088607595\" data-width=\"316\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 316px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/625406-everquest_box_art_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625406\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/625406-everquest_box_art_1_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>EverQuest</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On March 16, 1999, <a href=\"/everquest/3030-10796/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10796\">EverQuest</a> launched and carried both the Verant Interactive and 989 Studios logos on the box. The game quickly exceeded Sony's expectations and became one of the most popular games of all time. Later the same year, the studio released its third game, <a href=\"/infantry/3030-22275/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22275\">Infantry</a>, a top-down online combat game, but EverQuest's success was obviously the studio's main focus. Thirteen months after EQ's launch, Verant released the first expansion, <a href=\"/everquest-the-ruins-of-kunark/3030-7725/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7725\">The Ruins of Kunark</a>, which added an entire continent, new playable race, and many other new features.</p><p style=\"\">Shortly after the release of Kunark, Sony created the brand of Sony Online Entertainment and officially absorbed <a href=\"/verant-interactive/3010-6577/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6577\">Verant Interactive</a> under this new banner. Based on EverQuest's success, Sony planned to form a stable of MMO games and needed a brand to house them under. Although, the second expansion, <a href=\"/everquest-the-scars-of-velious/3030-13183/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13183\">The Scars of Velious</a>, released in December that year, still carried the <a href=\"/verant-interactive/3010-6577/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6577\">Verant</a> Interactive logo on the box. In April 2000, Sony created a branch of SOE in <a href=\"/texas/3035-1316/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1316\">Austin, Texas</a> and announced a deal with <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a> to create a <a href=\"/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/3030-9437/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9437\">Star Wars MMORPG</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Shortly before the release of EQ's third expansion, <a href=\"/everquest-the-shadows-of-luclin/3030-6204/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6204\">The Shadows of Luclin</a>, Brad McQuaid, the most prominent face of the game's design team, decided to leave the company along with many others to form <a href=\"/sigil-games-online-inc/3010-2997/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2997\">Sigil Games</a>. This left much of the expansion's content unfinished when it was released in December 2001. Many players would point to McQuaid's departure as the end of the games best content.</p><p style=\"\">Released at the end of 2002, the fourth expansion, <a href=\"/everquest-the-planes-of-power/3030-8390/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8390\">The Planes of Power</a>, while still a success in sales, is often considered the point where many of the game's long-time players began leaving the world of <a href=\"/norrath/3035-231/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-231\">Norrath</a>. Not to be forgotten, SOE released another smaller title called <a href=\"/cosmic-rift/3030-22290/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22290\">Cosmic Rift</a> in the Spring of 2002.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/607507-250px_star_wars_galaxies_box_art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607507\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.424\" data-width=\"250\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/607507-250px_star_wars_galaxies_box_art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607507\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/118/607507-250px_star_wars_galaxies_box_art.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/118/607507-250px_star_wars_galaxies_box_art.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Wars Galaxies</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The year of 2003 was a massive year for SOE.

February also saw the first spin-off of the franchise with <a href=\"/everquest-online-adventures/3030-19126/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19126\">EverQuest Online Adventures</a> for the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a>, which allowed console owners to experience the world of Norrath 500 years earlier in its history than PC players. In May, SOE released a second spin-off known as EverQuest: Hero's Call for cell phones and PDA's. Also in May, they released a new brand of MMO with <a href=\"/planetside/3030-14436/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14436\">Planetside</a>, a first-person shooter take on the genre. Then, in June, was the juggernaut release of <a href=\"/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/3030-9437/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9437\">Star Wars Galaxies</a>. EverQuest's sixth expansion, <a href=\"/everquest-lost-dungeons-of-norrath/3030-8979/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8979\">Lost Dungeons of Norrath</a>, released in September, featuring the first appearance of <a href=\"/instance/3015-1181/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1181\">instanced</a> zones in the game.

SOE closed out 2003 with the release of a third spin-off of the EQ franchise with an <a href=\"/real-time-combat/3015-2332/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">RTS</a> called <a href=\"/lords-of-everquest/3030-15936/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15936\">Lords of EverQuest</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In February 2004, SOE released the seventh expansion to EQ, <a href=\"/everquest-gates-of-discord/3030-6116/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6116\">Gates of Discord</a>, and a fourth spin-off of the franchise, <a href=\"/champions-of-norrath/3030-13217/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13217\">Champions of Norrath</a>, which allowed players to explore Norrath through a <a href=\"/diablo/3025-148/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-148\">Diablo</a> style <a href=\"/hack-and-slash/3015-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-469\">hack 'n slash</a> action game.

SOE opened a studio in <a href=\"/seattle/3035-517/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-517\">Seattle</a> in October as well.

Alongside the release, SOE launched their Station Players website that featured player profiles, leaderboards, guild pages, and item databases for all of their games.</p><p style=\"\">In January 2005, SOE announced a new program called <a href=\"/platform-publishing/3010-2308/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2308\">Platform Publishing</a> allowing third party developers a channel to get their games published through SOE.

In August, SOE acquired Worlds Apart Productions, a leader in <a href=\"/card-battle/3015-1068/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1068\">card games</a>, and renamed them <a href=\"/soe-denver/3010-6799/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6799\">SOE Denver</a>.

However, due to a resurgence in popularity of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-17\" href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" slug=\"mac\">      Macintosh</a> system after 2000, the brand was revived under United Developers, LLC who aquired the brandname from<a data-ref-id=\"3010-580\" href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" slug=\"interplay-entertainment-corp\">      Interplay</a>. MacPlay thusforth continued to release and port games on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-17\" href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" slug=\"mac\">    Macintosh</a>, including titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8142\" href=\"/alien-vs-predator/3030-8142/\" slug=\"alien-vs-predator\">                   Alien vs. Predator</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10637\" href=\"/baldurs-gate-ii-shadows-of-amn/3030-10637/\" slug=\"baldurs-gate-ii-shadows-of-amn\">                 Baldur's Gate II</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6735\" href=\"/sacrifice/3030-6735/\" slug=\"sacrifice\">                Sacrifice</a>. However, the last game to ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-17\" href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" slug=\"mac\">   Macintosh</a> by MacPlay was <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14819\" href=\"/tron-20/3030-14819/\" slug=\"tron-20\">               Tron 2.0</a> in 2004.

These games provided a fun way to introduce school age children to math, reading, logic, spelling, typing, science, and other educational concepts. <br/><br/>The Learning Company was founded in 1980 by educators Ann McCormick, Leslie Grimm, and Teri Perl. Part of the original funding for the company came from a National Science Foundation grant. The Learning Company first went public in 1992 and was purchased by SoftKey in 1995 for $606 million. Later, Mattel purchased The Learning Company in 1999 for $3.8 billion, renaming it to Mattel Interactive. Seeing this as a poor business decision, Mattel eventually sold TLC to Gores Technology Group for $27.3 million. Currently The Learning Co. is now a subsidiary of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a U.S. based educational publisher."

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Silicon Knights was founded in 1992 by <a href=\"/denis-dyack/3040-20252/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-20252\">Denis Dyack</a> in his home town of St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The studio began as a developer of PC games, but transitioned to console development in in 1996 to make games for the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Sony Playstation</a>, beginning with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/3030-8736/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8736\">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In 1998, the Canadian developer was signed by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> to be an exclusive second party developer. Under that deal, Silicon Knights developed only two games: <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/3030-7512/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a> and <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes/3030-9594/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9594\">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</a>, the latter of which was overseen by both Konami and Nintendo. Both titles were published on the Nintendo <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Silicon Knights's exclusive relationship with Nintendo ended in 2004, and in 2005 <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> announced a partnership with the studio. However, nothing of this partnership ever took form.</p><h2>Too Human</h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/too-human/3030-20499/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20499\">Too Human</a> began development as a title for the original PlayStation, but progress was shelved while Silicon Knights worked on Eternal Darkness and Metal Gear Solid. After the split from Nintendo, the studio revisited the Too Human concept and restarted the game's development as an Xbox 360 title. It was published by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a> in 2007 and was intended to be the first part of a trilogy.</p><p style=\"\">However, a cool critical reception and poor sales of Too Human delayed those plans. At around the same time, Silicon Knights became embroiled in a legal argument with <a href=\"/epic-games/3010-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic Games</a> over the use and support of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-86\">Unreal Engine 3</a>. Silicon Knights claimed that Epic provided insufficient support for the engine, hampering their development on Too Human while Epic used the licensing profits to develop <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>. Epic retaliated with a countersuit. Silicon Knights abandoned use of UE3 in favor of developing their own engine for Too Human and future projects.</p><h2>Collapse</h2><p style=\"\">In 2011, Silicon Knights partnered with <a href=\"/activision-blizzard-inc/3010-6397/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6397\">Activision Blizzard</a> and released <a href=\"/x-men-destiny/3030-32853/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32853\">X-Men: Destiny</a> to average to poor reviews. It was later alleged that the studio had used development funds granted to them by Activision intended for X-Men: Destiny to instead work in secret on a tech demo for a potential Eternal Darkness sequel. Further compounding Silicon Knights's troubles, the company lost their suit against Epic in large part due to the fact that the game engine code in Too Human and X-Men: Destiny, supposedly created using a new internal engine, in fact featured large chunks of code taken from the Unreal Engine. As part of Epic's legal victory, the court ordered all unsold copies of both Too Human and X-Men: Destiny destroyed.</p><p style=\"\">Since the release of X-Men: Destiny, the vast majority of the staff at Silicon Knights, including Denis Dyack, have left the company. What remains of the studio has been locked in legal appeals to Epic's triumph in court.</p><h2>Games</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Publisher</th><th>Release Year</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"/cyber-empires/3030-14270/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14270\">Cyber Empires</a></td><td><a href=\"/strategic-simulations-inc/3010-34/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-34\">Strategic Simulations</a></td><td>1992</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/fantasy-empires/3030-18327/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18327\">Fantasy Empires</a></td><td><a href=\"/strategic-simulations-inc/3010-34/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-34\">Strategic SImulations</a></td><td>1993</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/dark-legions/3030-876/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-876\">Dark Legions</a></td><td><a href=\"/strategic-simulations-inc/3010-34/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-34\">Strategic Simulations</a></td><td>1994</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/3030-8736/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8736\">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a></td><td><a href=\"/crystal-dynamics-inc/3010-959/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-959\">Crystal Dynamics</a></td><td>1996</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/3030-7512/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a></td><td><a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a></td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes/3030-9594/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9594\">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</a></td><td><a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a></td><td>2004</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/too-human/3030-20499/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20499\">Too Human</a></td><td><a href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft Studios</a></td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/x-men-destiny/3030-32853/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32853\">X-Men: Destiny</a></td><td><a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a></td><td>2011</td></tr></tbody></table>"

After graduating from UCLA a year before, the three computing graduates decided to form a gaming company called Silicon &amp; Synapse, which referred to the building block of the computer (silicon) and the human mind (synapse).</p><p style=\"\">Under that name, the company developed games for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super NES</a> like <a href=\"/rock-n-roll-racing/3030-18026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18026\">Rock n' Roll Racing</a>, <a href=\"/the-lost-vikings/3030-5429/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5429\">The Lost Vikings</a> and <a href=\"/blackthorne/3030-4549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4549\">Blackthorne</a>. Silicon &amp; Synapse garnered many awards within those years but received backlash for its company name. Many mistook it to be a breast implant firm because of the word <i>\"silicon,\"</i> which led them to briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios but it did not help either. Many people had trouble pronouncing the name (mispronunciations ranged from <i>\"chows\"</i> to <i>\"Chads\"</i>) and discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.</p><p style=\"\">In early 1994 they were acquired by distributor Davidson &amp; Associates for $6.75 million. The same year the three year old gaming company switched its name to Ogre Studios but Davidson &amp; Associates went against it because they felt <i>\"ogre\"</i> was too scary for the target audience. Finally, after numerous discussions within the team, they finally settled on Blizzard Entertainment.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Blizzard's three main intellectual properties include the <a href=\"/warcraft/3025-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-4\">Warcraft</a><b>,</b> <a href=\"/starcraft/3025-326/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-326\">StarCraft</a>, and <a href=\"/diablo/3025-148/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-148\">Diablo</a> franchises. Each franchise boasts an impressive, and almost \"cult-like\" following of fans, that have made Blizzard one of the most easily recognizable names in the gaming industry today.</p><p style=\"\">In July 2008 Vivendi Games, who at the time owned Blizzard Entertainment, merged with game publisher <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a>. Using Blizzard's name as a marketing tool to promote the company and deal as a merger and not a direct buyout, named the resulting company <a href=\"/activision-blizzard-inc/3010-6397/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6397\">Activision Blizzard</a>.</p><h3>Conventions</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13913/337924-murky.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337924\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3045454545455\" data-width=\"220\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13913/337924-murky.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337924\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13913/337924-murky.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A \"Murky\" pet that was given away to attendees of the first Blizzcon in 2005.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It is due to this incredible community that has developed around these three unique IPs and the unprecedented success of their hit titles like <i>StarCraft</i> and <i>World of Warcraft</i> that Blizzard is able to host it's own convention's; namely <u><b>BlizzCon</b></u> and the <u><b>Worldwide Invitational</b></u> (or WWI). These conventions boast a number of incredible events such as tournaments for <a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">Warcraft 3</a>, <a href=\"/starcraft/3030-13062/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\">StarCraft,</a> <a href=\"/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/3030-42033/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42033\">Hearthstone</a> and <a href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\">World of Warcraft</a> arena tournaments, costume and machinima contests, as well as major announcements concerning their three flagship franchises.</p><ul><li>The first BlizzCon was held in Anaheim, California at the Anaheim Convention Center in 2005 and has since been held on a semi-regular basis. It has been held since in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In July 2008, Blizzard announced they would be partnering with DirectTV to televise BlizzCon 2008.</li><li>The third Worldwide Invitational was held in May 2007 in Seoul, Korea and featured the unveiling of the highly anticipated <a href=\"/starcraft-ii/3030-20674/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\">StarCraft II</a>. The fourth WWI was held in Paris, France in June 2008 with the announcement of <a href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III</a> and information concerning the second expansion to their massive multiplayer online RPG World of Warcraft, <a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20701\">The Wrath of the Lich King</a>. Previous WWI events were held in Seoul, Korea and featured professional, or \"eSports\" tournaments but no new product announcements.</li><li>On top of the many prizes and tournaments going on, Blizzard has also made a habit out of giving away special codes that can be redeemed in World of Warcraft for different aesthetic purposes. Things such as in-game pets that follow a player around, or a suit that dresses them up are just a few things that Blizzard has given away exclusively at their events.</li><li>Blizzard has announced and is holding the next Blizzcon in August of 2009. The convention will, as the previous Blizzcon of 2008, be available to non-attendee's through DirectTV for a nominal fee. It will also be available for purchase to be viewed via a streaming feed online.</li><li>Blizzard has announced that BlizzCon 2010 is scheduled for October 2010 at the Anaheim Convention Center.</li><li>Blizzard canceled BlizzCon 2012, in order to have more time to work on their current projects.</li></ul><h3><b>Battle.net</b></h3><p style=\"\">In 1997 Blizzard released an online gaming service called <a href=\"/battlenet/3015-2077/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2077\"><b>Battle.net</b></a> that allows players from around the world to play together for free. This service has been implemented into most of Blizzard's titles. Battle.net has an array of functions including a matchmaking service and custom gameplay support that allows players to create their own maps and game types to share and play online. One such game type called <b>Defense of the Ancients</b> (or DoTA) in WarCraft 3 has since grown to become somewhat of a phenomenon similar to the original Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life.</p><p style=\"\">With the release of StarCraft II, Blizzard announced that an all new Battle.net service titled Battle.net 2.0 will launch concurrently with the game. Battle.net 2.0 features cross game features with all upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, including backwards compatibility with World of WarCraft. In 2009, Blizzard required all World of Warcraft accounts be changed into battle.net accounts to prepare for the service.</p><h2>Games of Blizzard</h2><h3>As Silicon &amp; Synapse</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/radical-pyscho-machine-racing/3030-28137/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28137\">RPM Racing</a></b> (1991)</li><li><b><a href=\"/the-lost-vikings/3030-5429/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5429\">The Lost Vikings</a></b> (1992)</li><li><b><a href=\"/rock-n-roll-racing/3030-18026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18026\">Rock N' Roll Racing</a></b> (1993)</li></ul><h3>As Blizzard Entertainment</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/blackthorne/3030-4549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4549\">Blackthorne</a></b> (1994)</li><li><b><a href=\"/the-death-and-return-of-superman/3030-11075/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11075\">The Death and Return of Superman</a></b> (1994)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-orcs-humans/3030-9719/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9719\">Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</a></b> (1994)</li><li><a href=\"/justice-league-task-force/3030-16349/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16349\"><b>Justice League Task Force</b></a> (1995)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-ii-tides-of-darkness/3030-20103/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20103\">Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</a></b> (1995)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-ii-beyond-the-dark-portal/3030-11816/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11816\">Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal</a></b> (1996)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo/3030-5985/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5985\">Diablo</a></b> (1996)</li><li><b><a href=\"/norse-by-norse-west-the-return-of-the-lost-vikings/3030-4134/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4134\">The Lost Vikings II</a></b> (1997)</li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft/3030-13062/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\">StarCraft</a></b> (1998)</li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-brood-war/3030-5415/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5415\">StarCraft: Brood War</a></b> (1998)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo-ii/3030-1119/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1119\">Diablo II</a></b> (2000)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction/3030-15589/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15589\">Diablo II: Lord of Destruction</a></b> (2001)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</a></b> (2002)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/3030-14073/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14073\">Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</a></b> (2003)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\">World of Warcraft</a></b> (2004)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/3030-18603/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18603\">World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</a></b> (2007)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20701\">World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</a></b> (2008)</li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\">StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</a></b> (2010)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/3030-27896/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27896\">World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</a></b> (2010)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III</a></b> (2012)</li><li><strong><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/3030-36734/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36734\">World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria</a></strong> (2012)</li><li><strong><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/3030-24078/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24078\">StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm</a> </strong>(2013)</li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/3030-42033/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42033\"><b>Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</b></a> (2014)</li><li><strong><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/3030-43649/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43649\">Diablo III: Reaper of</a><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/3030-43649/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43649\"> Souls</a> </strong>(2014)</li><li><strong><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/3030-44468/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44468\">World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor</a></strong> (2014)</li><li><b><a href=\"/heroes-of-the-storm/3030-36739/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36739\">Heroes of the Storm</a> </b>(2015)</li></ul><h3>Games In Development or Rumored</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/3030-24079/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24079\">StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void</a></b></li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/overwatch/3030-48190/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48190\">Overwatch</a></b></li></ul><h3>Games Cancelled</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/warcraft-adventures-lord-of-the-clans/3030-21298/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21298\"><b>Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans</b></a></li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-ghost/3030-21221/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21221\">StarCraft Ghost</a></b></li><li><a href=\"/titan-working-title/3030-33432/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33432\"><b>Titan</b></a></li></ul><h2>Key Figures</h2><ul><li><b><a href=\"/michael-morhaime/3040-3442/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3442\">Michael Morhaime</a></b> -

He entered an exclusive negotiating deal with Terry Phillips of SouthPeak in order to prevent GameCock from drying up entirely and in less than a week on October 14, 2008 the acquisition was complete. SouthPeak's strategy in dealing with the outstanding debts of GameCock was to inform the debtors that they were going to pay half of what was owed, and if the debtor didn't like it <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/14/page-2-interview-mike-wilson/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> they could sue</a>. Further investigation revealed that this was SouthPeak's general stance towards debt and continued while they were posting record profits.</p><p style=\"\">The GameCock troubles did not end there. In early 2008 a deal between <a href=\"/cdv-software-entertainment-ag/3010-651/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-651\"> CDV</a> and GameCock had been made essentially licensing seven games from GameCock to CDV (<a href=\"/dementium-the-ward/3030-9170/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9170\"> Dementium</a>, <a href=\"/insecticide/3030-20529/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20529\"> Insecticide</a>, <a href=\"/mushroom-men/3025-1568/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1568\"> Mushroom Men</a>, <a href=\"/velvet-assassin/3030-20573/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20573\"> Velvet Assassin</a>, <a href=\"/hail-to-the-chimp/3030-20520/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20520\"> Hail to the Chimp</a>, <a href=\"/pirates-vs-ninjas-dodgeball/3030-20563/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20563\"> Pirates vs. Ninjas</a> and <a href=\"/stronghold-crusader-extreme/3030-22846/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22846\"> Stronghold Crusader Extreme</a>). However, four of those titles slipped out of 2008 while GameCock was being acquired. SouthPeak continued to publish those four titles, and CDV sued them for copyright infringement and breach of contract, winning both accounts in a German court.</p><p style=\"\">Development studios working for SouthPeak have filed litigation on unpaid expenses repeatedly to mixed success. The most recent of these is <a href=\"/paradox-interactive-ab/3010-1366/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1366\"> Paradox Interactive</a> who filed on March 19, 2010 claiming that SouthPeak was delinquent on over $500,000 of payment for software sales. SouthPeak has claimed that it is now insolvent and unable to make payment.</p><p style=\"\">During the Midway bankruptcy proceedings in late 2009, SouthPeak acquired the license for <a href=\"/tna-impact/3025-1185/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1185\"> TNA Impact</a> in hopes to produce another title.</p>"

Half-Life went on to spawn two official expansion packs (<a href=\"/half-life-opposing-force/3030-16508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16508\">Opposing Force</a> and <a href=\"/half-life-blue-shift/3030-7814/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7814\">Blue Shift</a>, both developed by <a href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\">Gearbox</a>, not Valve) and several multiplayer mods, including <a href=\"/counter-strike/3025-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-114\">Counter-Strike</a>, which for years after its release has consistently remained one of the most-played online shooters.</p><p style=\"\">After the success of Half-Life, Valve stayed fairly quiet for a number of years, tending to the burgeoning mod communities to which Half-Life had given rise and doing R&amp;D work on their next game engine. Finally, in 2004, Valve again shook the world of PC games with the critically acclaimed sequel to Half-Life, simply titled <a href=\"../../half-life-2/61-1539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Half-Life 2</a>. The game quickly became renowned for its atmospheric story-telling, polished gameplay, and robust <a href=\"../../physics-manipulation/92-88/\" rel=\"nofollow\">physics</a> system that could be easily and dramatically manipulated via the <a href=\"../../zero-point-energy-field-manipulator/93-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gravity Gun</a>.

Following the release of Episode One, Valve began work on <a href=\"../../the-orange-box/61-17729/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Orange Box</a>.

The game saw the player navigating the <a href=\"../../aperture-science-enrichment-center/95-94/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aperture Science Enrichment Center</a> using a Portal Gun to <a href=\"../../teleportation/92-8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">teleport</a> and maneuver through physics-based <a href=\"../../puzzles/92-932/\" rel=\"nofollow\">puzzles</a>. The Orange Box was released in 2007, and garnered much critical acclaim for the variety, quality, and overall value of the games comprising it.

The beta began in 2011 and officially released in July 2013 prior to Valves tournament The International 3.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>History</h2><h3>Beginnings</h3><p style=\"\">Valve was set up on August 24th 1996 by two former <a href=\"../../microsoft-game-studios/65-340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft</a> employees: <a href=\"../../gabe-newell/72-4498/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gabe Newell</a> and <a href=\"../../mike-harrington/72-89791/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Harrington</a>. They were based in Kirkland, WA and were a Limited Liable Company (L.L.C). While still at Microsoft both Newell and Harrington played key roles in the development and success of Microsoft's Window's operating system.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14728/375472-gabe_newell.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-375472\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.24\" data-width=\"200\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14728/375472-gabe_newell.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-375472\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14728/375472-gabe_newell.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14728/375472-gabe_newell.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gabe Newell.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After acquiring the rights to the <a href=\"../../quake-engine/92-1278/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quake Engine</a> from <a href=\"../../id-software/65-347/\" rel=\"nofollow\">id Software</a> Valve began working on their first game <a href=\"../../half-life/61-2980/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Half-life</a>. Set to become a company tradition, the game suffered several delays and restarts and was pushed back from it's intended release in 1997 to the end of 1998.</p><p style=\"\">The game was eventually released on November 19th 1998 by <a href=\"../../sierra-online/65-2934/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sierra</a> <a href=\"../../sierra-online/65-2934/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Online</a>. It received universal accolades for it's immersive environments, interactiveness and unique narrative all while still being a solid FPS. This was combined with commercial success and as of 2008 the game has sold in excess of 9.8 million copies.</p><p style=\"\">Valve would continue the development philosophy on Half-life in their later games which is a partial reason to their success and loyal fanbase.</p><h3>Mod and Indie Support</h3><p style=\"\">What Valve Corporation is best known for is their big support for user created content. When Half-Life was first released in 1998, mods were created to expand the multiplayer, the most prominent being Counter Strike. When Counter Strike was first released as a free mod, it quickly became a hit. Valve liked what they saw in the mod and on April 20, 2000, Valve hired the Counter Strike developers in order to make a full game out of the mod. Thus <a href=\"../../half-life-counter-strike/61-11663/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Half Life: Counter Strike</a> was born.</p><p style=\"\">Many other mods would be created for Half Life, including Team Fortress (which was released as a Quake mod before coming to Half Life) and Day of Defeat.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2839/1194964-garry_s_mod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194964\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2839/1194964-garry_s_mod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194964\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2839/1194964-garry_s_mod.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2839/1194964-garry_s_mod.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scene from Garry's Mod</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">When Valve released the Steam client in 2003, there wasn't much support in their store. As they expanded within the next few years, Valve decided to bring some modders and indie developers to make games for the Steam service. Valve gives modders the proper tools to make mods. When <a href=\"../../half-life-2/61-1539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Half Life 2</a> was released, it introduced the new <a href=\"../../source-engine/92-751/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a> engine. To better attract modders, Valve released the <a href=\"../../source-sdk/92-2757/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source SDK</a>. It became the standard tool to create new maps, new enemies, and whole new mods for Valve's titles.</p><p style=\"\">The most famous of all of the new Source mods is <a href=\"../../garrys-mod/61-20617/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garry's Mod</a>. Created in 2004 by <a href=\"../../garry-newman/72-89950/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garry Newman</a>, Garry's Mod was a simple construction tool used to play in maps with the ragdolls from many Source games, life Half Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2, and Left 4 Dead. It soon became one of the biggest mods for Half Life 2. Now the simple mod has expanded into an expansive tool used by many people, from modders to machinima makers. In fact, version 11 is available on Steam and is now considered a full game (but still requires the owner own another Source based game to run).</p><p style=\"\">Indie games became an important part of Steam. With the introduction of Steamworks, Valve has been trying to get the community involved with the service. Games like <a href=\"../../audiosurf/61-9436/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Audiosurf</a> and <a href=\"../../world-of-goo/61-20647/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World of Goo</a> became a big part of the Steam service, expanding its library of games from the regular publishers to the new indie developers getting a good start in gaming.</p><h3>Important Dates</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/901596-ny_c2a5e0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-901596\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/901596-ny_c2a5e0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-901596\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13692/901596-ny_c2a5e0001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13692/901596-ny_c2a5e0001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scene from Half-life.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>August 24th, 1996</b> - Valve Software is set up by <a href=\"../../gabe-newell/72-4498/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gabe Newell</a> and <a href=\"../../mike-harrington/72-89791/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Harrington</a>.</li><li><b>November 19th, 1998</b> - <a href=\"../../half-life/61-2980/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Half-life</a> is released.</li><li><b>March 25th, 1999</b> - <a href=\"../../half-life-counter-strike/61-11663/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Counter Strike</a> is released as a mod for Half-life.</li><li><b>April 7th, 1999</b> - <a href=\"../../team-fortress-classic/61-4561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Team Fortress Classic</a> is released, a remake of the original Quake mod based on the GoldSrc engine.</li><li><b>January 15th 2000</b> - Mike Harrington dissolves his partnership with Valve, giving Gabe Newell full control.</li><li><b>April 20th, 2000</b> - Valve hires the developers of <a href=\"../../counter-strike/62-114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Counter Strike</a>.</li><li><b>2003</b> - Valve moves to Bellvue, WA after becoming a corporation.</li><li><b>September 12th, 2003</b> - Valve releases its <a href=\"../../steam/92-718/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam</a> client.</li><li><b>November 16th, 2004</b> - <a href=\"../../half-life-2/61-1539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Half-life 2</a> is finally released, after numerous delays and complications, to glowing reviews.</li><li><b>June 1st 2006</b> - <a href=\"../../half-life-2-episode-one/61-14328/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HL2: Episode 1</a> is released.

They partnered with the UK-based company <a href=\"/psygnosis-limited/3010-448/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-448\">Psygnosis</a>, who would later create the <a href=\"/wipeout/3025-205/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-205\">Wipeout series</a>, to make a number of 2D sidescrolling shooters, including <a href=\"/menace/3030-6837/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6837\">Menace</a> for the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a> and <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a>.</p><h3>1990s</h3><p style=\"\">DMA's major breakthrough was in 1990 with <a href=\"/lemmings/3030-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1446\">Lemmings</a>, a 2D platformer. It was released on the Amiga, NES and Mac selling over 20 million copies. The years beyond this were spent creating many more Lemmings games, including Christmas special editions. In 1993, Psygnosis were bought out by Sony and this would start the beginning of their troubled relationship. DMA released <a href=\"/uniracers/3030-16228/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16228\">Uniracers</a> as their first game without Psygnosis shortly after. In 1994, DMA wereasked by major console giant <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> to design a game for their upcoming Ultra 64 system, now known as the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>. DMA designed a game called <a href=\"/body-harvest/3030-18772/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18772\">Body Harvest</a>, however numerous changes were asked to be included in order appeal to the Japanese market. After many delays Nintendo dropped out of publishing the game, and <a href=\"/midway-games/3010-185/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway Games</a> took over.</p><h3>Grand Theft Auto</h3><p style=\"\">In the meantime DMA was releasing <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3030-13567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13567\">Grand Theft Auto</a> on the PC while another developer ported it to the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation</a>. It used a number of ideas from Body Harvest, the 2D top down perspective and the ability to get into any car was a major focus. The game followed a character who would make his way up the criminal ranks in three fictional US cities. The game sparked controversy due to its display of violence; especially the British newspaper <i>Daily Mail</i> which said it should be banned. This controversy was likely a benefactor to the game's success.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/927697-grand_theft_auto_iv_screen_for_june_27th_2007__2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927697\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/927697-grand_theft_auto_iv_screen_for_june_27th_2007__2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927697\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/927697-grand_theft_auto_iv_screen_for_june_27th_2007__2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>GTA IV's protagonist, Nico Bellic.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After the success of Grand Theft Auto, DMA was bought by <a href=\"/gremlin-interactive-ltd/3010-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3\">Gremlin interactive</a>. During this time DMA put out two games, Body Harvest for the PC and <a href=\"/wild-metal-country/3030-1571/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1571\">Wild Metal Country</a>. In 1999 Gremlin was bought out by <a href=\"/atari-sa/3010-548/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-548\">Infogrames</a>, complicating things for DMA as they had an existing deal with <a href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony</a>. In the end Gremlin sold DMA to <a href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-450\">Take Two Interactive</a> and the existing deal with Sony was called Rockstar Games. For the rest of the 1990s DMA released <a href=\"/wild-metal/3030-23930/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23930\">Wild Metal</a> for the <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast</a> and <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-2/3030-10593/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10593\">Grand Theft Auto 2</a> for the PC and <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation</a>.</p><h3>2000s</h3><p style=\"\">In 2001 Rockstar Games released <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a> using <a href=\"/criterion-games/3010-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-315\">Criterion</a>s graphics middleware <a href=\"/renderware/3015-3521/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3521\">RenderWare</a> on the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2</a>. The game became a huge success in the US and EU; because of this Sony signed a deal to keep the game exclusive. It was at this point that Rockstar bought DMA and changed their name to Rockstar North in 2002.</p><p style=\"\">The following year would see the massive release of the PC version of <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a> and the release of <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-vice-city/3030-17036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17036\">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>. In 2003 a port was made for Vice City and GTA 3 to <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Microsofts Xbox</a> and to the PC. The developer would then change and go a different route in 2003 releasing the hyper-violent <a href=\"/manhunt/3030-6108/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6108\">Manhunt</a> on PS2. The company then went back to GTA the following year releasing <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> to huge critical and commercial acclaim.</p><p style=\"\">The time from 2004 was spent readying Rockstar North for the next generation of consoles with the release of <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\">GTA IV</a> on the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PS3</a> in April 2008.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Tose is a Japanese developer that was founded in 1979 as a spin-off from Toa Seiko, a Japanese electronics and technology development firm. Specializing predominantly in outsourced work from other development companies in both Japan and overseas, although it is only officially credited on a handful of games, most notably all of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6727\" href=\"/game-watch-gallery/3030-6727/\" slug=\"game-watch-gallery\">Game &amp; Watch Gallery</a> games, as well as the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-585\" href=\"/the-legendary-starfy/3025-585/\" slug=\"the-legendary-starfy\">Starfy</a> franchise, which is its own creation, Tose is believed to have been involved in the development of 1100-plus games for numerous platforms in various capacities over the years ranging from graphics support to full development. However, since it routinely declines to be credited in most of the games to which they contribute work, it has come to be known as a \"ninja developer,\" with portions of its exact resume largely being made apparent either by clients that make its hiring known, such as Square-Enix for Enix/Dragon Quest franchise-related ports, or by forensic work done on both the games themselves and external resources related to the company. The ways involved in the latter method include financial reports and ROM hacking, among other means.</p><p style=\"\">The developer's secrecy extends as far as its work force, with even its upper management often preferring anonymity over having their names made known. Sporting over 1000 employees, Tose is one of the world's largest developers that, with one exception in the form of the PSP Network title Susume Tactics, doesn't also do publishing work. In addition to the main office in Japan, it also maintains branch offices in the United States and China.</p><h2>Corporate Relationships</h2><p style=\"\">The following is a list of companies with which Tose has been to known to work as either a fellow game developer or in a game development capacity. Although many of the companies listed are officially disclosed on the company's official Japanese page, if sufficient proof is available via other sources (ie: financial reports, etc.), those companies are also deemed fit for inclusion.

During their early years they established the foundation of the company, which later led to the purchase of Neversoft by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\">Activision</a>. The purchase was the beginning of a great time for both Neversoft and Activision. One of their first games together, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7236\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater/3030-7236/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>, gained great critical acclaim and paved the way to a successfull future.</p><p style=\"\">Neversoft continued to develop games in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-10\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\">Tony Hawk franchise</a> until 2007 when Activision offered them to work on the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\">Guitar Hero franchise</a> instead. Their first game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4031\" href=\"/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/3030-4031/\">Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</a>, became a great success and made over $100 million in its first week of release in North America, and as of July 2008, the game has sold more then 8 million copies worldwide.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1104737-800px_1998_neversoft_960.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104737\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.60375\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1104737-800px_1998_neversoft_960.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104737\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1104737-800px_1998_neversoft_960.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Neversoft team in 1998</figcaption></figure><ul><li>In July 1994, Neversoft was founded by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-6489\" href=\"/joel-jewett/3040-6489/\">Joel Jewett</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-6482\" href=\"/mick-west/3040-6482/\">Mick West</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-15296\" href=\"/chris-ward/3040-15296/\">Chris Ward</a> in Woodland Hills, California. They initially worked for <i>Playmates Toys</i>, where they begun development of a game for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-6\" href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\">Sega Genesis</a> to go along with a cartoon show called <i>Skeleton Warriors</i>.</li><li>In December 1994, five months later, the game was cancelled by Playmates Toys. Not because they were unhappy with the development progress, but because they wanted to join the 32-bit bandwagon and develop the game for the new <a data-ref-id=\"3045-42\" href=\"/saturn/3045-42/\">Sega Saturn</a>. At this time, Neversoft had expanded by hiring two additional employees; a level designer and another artist.</li><li>1995 was spent developing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7168\" href=\"/skeleton-warriors/3030-7168/\">Skeleton Warriors</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-42\" href=\"/saturn/3045-42/\">Sega Saturn</a>. Over the course of this year, Neversoft grew rapidly by hiring three programmers, five artists, a level designer, a tester and an office administrator. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7168\" href=\"/skeleton-warriors/3030-7168/\">Skeleton Warriors</a> was finished in time for the holiday season and Neversoft started to look for new work while they were porting the game to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\">Playstation</a>.</li><li>In 1996 Neversoft's staff grew to over twenty people. For six months they worked on a game based on <i>Ghost Rider</i> for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-959\" href=\"/crystal-dynamics-inc/3010-959/\">Crystal Dynamics</a>, which later was cancelled due to financial problems with the publisher. This gave them time and opportunity to work on a game of their own design called <i>Big Guns</i>. The engine they created for <i>Big Guns</i> was also to be used in their next project; they got the opportunity to convert the PC game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3419\" href=\"/mdk/3030-3419/\">MDK</a> to the Playstation. Towards the end of the year, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-995\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/\">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> bought the idea for <i>Big Guns</i> from Neversoft, and the game was now officially in development.</li><li>1997 was a tumultuous year for Neversoft. The <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3419\" href=\"/mdk/3030-3419/\">MDK</a> conversion were more complex and took far longer than expected, and the <i>Big Guns</i> game, which had been renamed <i>to Exodus</i> went through numerous design changes to satisfy <a data-ref-id=\"3010-995\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/\">Sony</a>, but it was eventually cancelled in November 1997. The company shrunk back to just twelve employees. Neversoft then spent the next few months improving on their engine, while looking for more work.</li><li>In January 1998, Neversoft was about to run out of money, but luckily they had a fortunate business meeting with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\">Activision</a>, who were looking for developers for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6823\" href=\"/apocalypse/3030-6823/\">Apocalypse</a>. Their <i>Big Guns</i> engine was ideal for the project and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\">Activision</a> and Neversoft sealed a business deal.</li><li>In May 1998 the development of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6823\" href=\"/apocalypse/3030-6823/\">Apocalypse</a> was going along nicely, and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\">Activision</a> additionally requested a prototype of a skateboarding game from Neversoft. The development of the prototype was going really slow, since Neversoft really couldn't spare anyone from the development of Apocalypse. The initial prototypes impressed Activision, and when Apocalypse was done in October 1998, Neversoft immediately begun working on what later should become known as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7236\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater/3030-7236/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\">Playstation</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\">Nintendo 64</a>. At this time Neversoft consisted 15 people: six programmers, five artists, three level designers and Joel, the President.</li><li>In the summer of 1999, their successful cooperation led to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\">Activision</a> acquiring Neversoft by a stock-swap deal.</li><li>In October 1999, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7236\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater/3030-7236/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> was released. Due to the game's great reception, Neversoft started development of a sequel immediately. Meanwhile, Neversoft also started development of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21586\" href=\"/spider-man/3030-21586/\">Spider-Man</a>, which meant Neversoft had to split into two separate development teams working in parallel.</li><li>In 2000, both <a data-ref-id=\"3030-990\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/3030-990/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</a> and Spider-Man were released, and Neversoft started development of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5688\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\">Playstation 2</a> using the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3521\" href=\"/renderware/3015-3521/\">RenderWare</a> engine.</li><li>In 2001, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5688\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> was released, and Neversoft once again immediately started working on a sequel.</li><li>In 2002, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2101\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4/3030-2101/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a> was released as well as a port of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the Xbox.</li><li>In 2003, Neversoft reworked the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-10\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\">Tony Hawk franchise</a> a bit, by taking a more story-oriented approach in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14896\" href=\"/tony-hawks-underground/3030-14896/\">Tony Hawk's Underground</a>, which was released the same year.</li><li>In 2004, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1492\" href=\"/tony-hawks-underground-2/3030-1492/\">Tony Hawk's Underground 2</a> was released. Neversoft once again decided to split the team into two groups to work on two games at once; the seventh game in the Tony Hawk franchise and the new game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8873\" href=\"/gun/3030-8873/\">GUN</a>.</li><li>In 2005, both <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7222\" href=\"/tony-hawks-american-wasteland/3030-7222/\">Tony Hawk's American Wasteland</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8873\" href=\"/gun/3030-8873/\">GUN</a> was released.</li><li>In 2006, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12077\" href=\"/tony-hawks-project-8/3030-12077/\">Tony Hawk's Project 8</a> was both developed and released. This was Neversoft's first game to hit the new generation of consoles consisting of <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\">Xbox 360</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\">Playstation 3</a>. Yet again, Neversoft started development of another <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3005-13/\">Tony Hawk</a> game.</li><li>In 2007, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20695\" href=\"/tony-hawks-proving-ground/3030-20695/\">Tony Hawk's Proving Ground</a> was released. This turned out to be the last <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3005-13/\">Tony Hawk</a> game developed by Neversoft, since <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\">Activision</a> recently acquired <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3468\" href=\"/redoctane-inc/3010-3468/\">RedOctane</a> and wanted Neversoft to continue the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\">Guitar Hero franchise</a>.

The company's original name was <b>Treyarch</b> Invention, LLC and initially found critical success with their original title, \" <a href=\"/die-by-the-sword/3030-1567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1567\">Die By the Sword</a>\" and its expansion pack, \" <a href=\"/die-by-the-sword-limb-from-limb/3030-13148/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13148\">Limb From Limb</a>\", both published by Interplay. Rapidly growing in size, <b>Treyarch</b> immedietly branched out and released their first sports title, <a href=\"/triple-play-2000/3030-14025/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14025\">Triple Play 2000</a>, for Electronic Arts in 1999 and its followup the following year.</p><p style=\"\">In 2000, <b>Treyarch</b> released their first <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast</a> games: the Mattel-licensed Max Steel: Covert Operations and their original title, Draconus: Cult of the Wurm. While neither would be critial or commercial hits, they provided the company with their first experience with the hardware that would ultimately bring them under Activision's umbrella. They were contracted to port the game Spider-Man (a major hit from the previous year) from the Playstation to the Dreamcast, winning them praise for developing inarguably the best version of the title yet, though the lack of any new content on a game that was over six months old tended to impact the final review scores. While Neversoft's original version received a Metacritic average of 87, Treyarch's port received a composite score of 80.</p><p style=\"\">The sports division at <b>Treyarch</b> remained busy churning out favorably received updates to the NHL 2K series (NHL 2K2 and NHL 2K3) for 2K Sports, Triple Play Baseball series for Electronic Arts, and developing the extreme sports / surfing title, \"Kelly Slater Pro Surfer\" for Activision. Their next non-sports title would be Minority Report in 2002, very loosely based on the film of the same title. Critics were strongly negative towards the title (X-Play named it one of the worst PS2 titles of all time in June of 2006), but it has retained a cult following on the internet for its indepth three dimensional beat 'em up combat engine.</p><p style=\"\">Activision purchased <b>Treyarch</b> outright in October of 2001 and it was in 2002 that <b>Treyarch</b> was able to finally catapault into the public spotlight with the high sales of their original Spider-Man title (based on the 2002 film of the same name). Despite criticism regarding the quality of the voice acting, game length and indoor camera behavior, reviewers rated the title positively and it went on to sell over three million copies across the console platforms. This success resulted in <b>Treyarch</b> being assigned work on the similarly well received sequel (Spider-Man 2)</p>"

They saw the potential of the growing multimedia industry at the time and started an initiative to turn Montreal into a multimedia hub. Called \"Plan Mercure\", it proposed subsidiaries for investing companies. After preliminary negotiations with Ubisoft, the plan hit a roadblock when it was deemed financially untenable for the government. But public &amp; media pressure persevered and Plan Mercure was eventually implemented in 1997 when Ubisoft finally set up their Montreal studio, with heavily subsidized jobs. Over the course of five years, 500 jobs were subsidized as the Quebec government contributed $15,000 per employee with the federal government contributing another $10,000 per employee. The policy did bear fruit in the long run since by 2010, the studio employed over 2500 employees in the area.</p><p style=\"\">Since the creation of Ubisoft Montreal, other publishers like <a href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">EA</a>, <a href=\"/eidos-studios-montreal/3010-6462/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6462\">Eidos</a>, <a href=\"/thq-montreal/3010-7633/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7633\">THQ</a> &amp; <a href=\"/wb-games/3010-4405/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4405\">Warner Bros</a> have also set up similar development houses in the area. In addition to heavy subsidization, Ubisoft has also cited the French speaking population and the area's low rent as reasons for choosing Montreal over other considered locations like New Brunswick.</p><h2>Games</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/230571-splintercell_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230571\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4166666666667\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/230571-splintercell_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230571\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11097/230571-splintercell_front.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Sam Fisher's adventures marked the beginning of a successful franchise.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After developing <a href=\"/tonic-trouble/3030-11027/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11027\">Tonic Trouble</a> &amp; <a href=\"/disneys-donald-duck-goin-quackers/3030-9551/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9551\">Goin' Quackers</a>, games aimed at a younger audience, Ubisoft Montreal's first big release was 2002's <a href=\"/tom-clancys-splinter-cell/3030-5961/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5961\">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>.

When questioned about this, Randy Pitchford (President of Gearbox) declined to confirm or deny the legitimacy of the reports, instead promising to clarify things at PAX. And clarify they did. Gearbox not only officially announced the game with a presentation by Randy Pitchford but also gave attendees the chance to play a demo of the game.</p><h2>Main Games</h2><h3>Brothers In Arm Series</h3><p style=\"\">Main Article: <a href=\"/brothers-in-arms/3025-617/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-617\">Brothers In Arms</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/584510-930277_20070924_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-584510\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7828125\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/584510-930277_20070924_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-584510\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/870/584510-930277_20070924_screen001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/870/584510-930277_20070924_screen001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Matt Baker, the main protagonist of the Brothers In Arm series</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unlike many <a href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II</a>-based shooters, the Brothers In Arms series focuses heavily on squad based gameplay and storytelling. In the first game as well as the third players take on the role of <a href=\"/matt-baker/3005-2364/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2364\">Sergeant Matt Baker</a> and experience his time in the war. The second main game in the series focuses on <a href=\"/joe-red-hartsock/3005-3353/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3353\">Joe \"Red\" Hartsock</a>'s experiences. What makes this point of view interesting is that Hartsock was one of Baker's squad mates. Some missions in the second game are actually from the first game, but you experience them from a different perspective.</p><p style=\"\">During the game, players are in control of two or three teams and can order them around and give orders. Two basic commands--Fall-in and hold position--are used in conjunction with the ability to direct teams to different spots on the map. By aiming at a group of enemies, players can order specific teams to attack them. The third game in the series, Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway, introduced heavy weapon teams like the bazooka team and machine gun team.</p><p style=\"\">The latest entry in the Brothers In Arms series was announced at <a href=\"/e3-2011/3015-6449/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6449\">E3 2011</a>. Called <a href=\"/brothers-in-arms-furious-4/3030-35549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35549\">Brothers In Arms: Furious Four</a>, the game takes a less serious approach to World War II and features four playable and unique protagonists.</p><p style=\"\">Gearbox has also developed games in the series for mobile devices, including one for the iPhone.</p><h3>Borderlands</h3><p style=\"\">Main Article: <a href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\">Borderlands</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/964471-spiderant_horde_1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-964471\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/964471-spiderant_horde_1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-964471\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/964471-spiderant_horde_1080.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/964471-spiderant_horde_1080.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Borderlands is set on the hostile planet of Pandora</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Borderlands was announced in 2007 but wasn't released until 2009. This was in part due to the massive change in visual styles; originally the game had realistic visuals like many shooters, but one day members of the team came up with the idea to make the game with a cel-shaded style and it stuck with Randy Pitchford. Borderlands now sports a comic book style of graphics.</p><p style=\"\">Borderlands is noted for its \"bazillions\" of guns. Guns were procedurally generated based on different statistics and factors like the type of gun barrel, overall damage, accuracy, scope, manufacturer, and more. As a result, it's unlikely that players will find the same gun twice in the game. The game also allows player to get online and experience the game with up to three other people.</p><p style=\"\">Before a sequel to Borderlands had been announced, the creative director for the game, Mike Neumann, said a <a href=\"/sequel/3015-3178/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3178\">sequel</a> \"seems like a no-brainer\" in an interview with VG247.

    "description": "<p style=\"\">Tiger Electronics was founded by Randy Rissman and Roger Shiffman in 1978. There original focus was on handheld electronic games and various toys with a teaching purpose. They later created 2 handheld cartridge systems that both failed to make a real impact on the market. After Tiger's failed attempts at video games they went back to the electronic toy market and are now part of Hasbro.</p><h2>R-Zone</h2><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-103\" href=\"/r-zone/3045-103/\" slug=\"r-zone\">R-Zone</a> was Tiger's first attempt at a handheld cartridge system seeing three variations between 1995-1997. The systems implemented LCD technology with the Head Gear edition resembling Nintendo's Vitual Boy, though the system was not built with competition in mind. All R-Zone games were reworked variations of existing Tiger handheld games.</p><h2>Game.com</h2><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-77\" href=\"/gamecom/3045-77/\" slug=\"gamecom\">Game.com</a>, pronounced game com, was Tiger's second and final attempt at a handheld cartridge system. Unlike the R-Zone, this handheld was built to directly compete against Nintendo's Game Boy. While also a commercial flop with only 20 games ever released, the system was the first to incorporate many features taken for granted today, including PDA-like features, a touch screen, a stylus, internet connectivity and the ability to insert 2 cartridges at once.</p><h3>Games</h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-13568\" href=\"/batman-robin/3030-13568/\" slug=\"batman-robin\">Batman &amp; Robin</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-1157\" href=\"/centipede/3030-1157/\" slug=\"centipede\">Centipede</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\" href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/\" slug=\"duke-nukem-3d\">Duke Nukem 3D</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-19043\" href=\"/fighters-megamix/3030-19043/\" slug=\"fighters-megamix\">Fighters</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19043\" href=\"/fighters-megamix/3030-19043/\" slug=\"fighters-megamix\">Megamix</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-11903\" href=\"/frogger/3030-11903/\" slug=\"frogger\">Frogger</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-9388\" href=\"/henry/3030-9388/\" slug=\"henry\">Henry</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27492\" href=\"/indy-500/3030-27492/\" slug=\"indy-500\">Indy 500</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-988\" href=\"/jeopardy/3030-988/\" slug=\"jeopardy\">Jeopardy!</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-22805\" href=\"/lights-out/3030-22805/\" slug=\"lights-out\">Lights Out</a> (pack in with new console)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-4125\" href=\"/the-lost-world-jurassic-park/3030-4125/\" slug=\"the-lost-world-jurassic-park\">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-2958\" href=\"/monopoly/3030-2958/\" slug=\"monopoly\">Monopoly</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-8279\" href=\"/mortal-kombat-trilogy/3030-8279/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat-trilogy\">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27706\" href=\"/quiz-wiz-cyber-trivia/3030-27706/\" slug=\"quiz-wiz-cyber-trivia\">Quiz Wiz: Cyber Trivia</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\" href=\"/resident-evil-2/3030-9418/\" slug=\"resident-evil-2\">Resident Evil 2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27707\" href=\"/scrabble/3030-27707/\" slug=\"scrabble\">Scrabble</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-2391\" href=\"/sonic-jam/3030-2391/\" slug=\"sonic-jam\">Sonic Jam</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-3528\" href=\"/tiger-casino/3030-3528/\" slug=\"tiger-casino\">Tiger Casino</a> (pack in with new console)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27709\" href=\"/wheel-of-fortune/3030-27709/\" slug=\"wheel-of-fortune\">Wheel of Fortune</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27710\" href=\"/wheel-of-fortune-2/3030-27710/\" slug=\"wheel-of-fortune-2\">Wheel of Fortune 2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-1956\" href=\"/williams-arcade-classics/3030-1956/\" slug=\"williams-arcade-classics\">Williams Arcade Classics</a></li></ul><h3>Canceled</h3><ul><li>A Bug's Life</li><li>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</li><li>Furbyland</li><li>Metal Gear Solid</li><li>NBA Hangtime</li><li>Shadow Madness (while never officially announced, it was seen in a commercial for the system)</li></ul>"

Garden bankrolled the first year of development on his credit card, until <a href=\"/sierra-entertainment-inc/3010-1030/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1030\">Sierra Entertainment</a> were introduced to their <a href=\"/homeworld/3030-11590/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11590\">Homeworld</a> project in April of 1998 and agreed to finance the game's development. With the new financial backing, Relic immediately shifted from their old 1600 sq foot office to a much larger 12,000 sq foot facility in Vancouver's historic Yaletown district and expanded by hiring Curtis Terry as CFO and Ron Moravek as COO.</p><h3>Homeworld</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1058320\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1058320\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Homeworld was the first fully 3-dimensional RTS.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After glowing previews at E3 the preview year, Homeworld was released in 1999 and earned several awards, including the prestigious \"Game of the Year\" award from PC Gamer and IGN. The game was universally lauded for its innovative, fully 3-dimensional gameplay and large, cinematic space battles. It was also scientifically <a href=\"http://www.relicnews.com/homeworld/hw-articles/better-than-pants/\" rel=\"nofollow\">proven</a> to be better than <a href=\"/pants/3055-1118/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1118\">pants</a>. A Homeworld spin-off, <a href=\"/homeworld-cataclysm/3030-14029/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14029\">Cataclysm</a>, was developed by <a href=\"/barking-dog-studios-ltd/3010-1609/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1609\">Barking Dog Studios</a> using the same engine and got an equally good critical reception.</p><p style=\"\">In December 1999, Relic started working on their next project, titled <i>Sigma: The Adventures of Rex Chance</i> which was eventually renamed and released as <a href=\"/impossible-creatures/3030-17778/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17778\">Impossible Creatures</a> by <a href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a> in December 2002. An RTS at its core, players can collect and combine various animal DNA to design their own units and armies. Relic also started work on an action adventure title in the same universe but it was cancelled due to the game's disappointing sales and critical reception.</p><p style=\"\">Relic's next release was the sequel <a href=\"/homeworld-2/3030-9473/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9473\">Homeworld 2</a> in 2003, with various graphical and gameplay enhancements. Though one of the most anticipated RTS titles that year, the final game didn't receive the same level of praise as the original and many reviewers cited a lack of significant evolution over the first as its main drawback. Later in 2003, Relic released the source code to the original and also continued supporting the mod community through their Relic Developer Network.</p><h2>Under THQ</h2><h3>Acquisition &amp; Dawn of War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/155745/2261322-warhammer_40000___dawn_of_war_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2261322\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4324082363474\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/155745/2261322-warhammer_40000___dawn_of_war_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2261322\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/155745/2261322-warhammer_40000___dawn_of_war_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dawn of War shifted the focus from resource management to combat.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Relic entered a multi-property publishing agreement with <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a> in April 2003 and soon announced that they were working on <a href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/3030-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2115\">Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War</a>, an RTS based on <a href=\"/games-workshop-ltd/3010-1986/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1986\">Games Workshop's</a> Warhammer 40,000 IP. A year later in April 2004, THQ acquired Relic for close to $10 million in an all cash agreement. In October 2004, Relic crossed the 100 employees mark.</p><p style=\"\">Dawn of War was released on September 20, 2004 to commercial and critical success. It innovated on the old RTS formula by cutting down on resource management, instead focusing on smaller but more powerful squad-based armies. The game was also very popular among Warhammer fans for a faithful translation of the popular franchise. Relic built on its success and developed the expansion <a href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-winter-assault/3030-19335/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19335\">Winter Assault</a>, adding the Imperial Guard faction in the mix.

With over 4 million sales (including the expansion packs), Dawn of War remains one of the highest selling PC games of all time. Also in 2006, Relic made their first foray into console gaming with the <a href=\"/the-outfit/3030-15503/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15503\">The Outfit</a> for the Xbox 360. The game tried to mix squad based strategies with third person shooting but received an average critical reception.</p><h3>Company of Heroes &amp; more Warhammer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/656187-cohepc0f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-656187\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4109375\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/656187-cohepc0f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-656187\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/656187-cohepc0f.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/656187-cohepc0f.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Relic's WW-II RTS won them the 'Developer of the Year' award in 2006.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Using their new Essence Engine, Relic released the World War II-themed RTS <a href=\"/company-of-heroes/3030-18930/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18930\">Company of Heroes</a> on Sept 11, 2006. It took the squad based mechanics from Dawn of War even further by adding additional cover mechanics and advanced physics for destructible environments. It was also one of the first games to fully integrate DirectX 10 and featured <a href=\"/high-dynamic-range/3015-618/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-618\">HDR</a> and dynamic lighting.

Players took control of a handful of space marines and slowly built them using talent trees and item drops. It also took several cues from the Company of Heroes series by making cover &amp; positioning more significant during combat. The game earned mostly positive reviews, with most players praising the fast paced combat but also criticizing the lack of mission variety and multiplayer maps. An expansion, <a href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-chaos-rising/3030-28188/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28188\">Chaos Rising</a>, was released a year later which further built on the story &amp; mechanics of the original, while also adding the popular Last Stand mode - a horde-mode equivalent for Warhammer champions.</p><p style=\"\">In 2011, Relic released the standalone expansion <a href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-retribution/3030-32362/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32362\">Dawn of War II: Retribution</a> which introduced 6 playable races for the single player campaign and replaced <a href=\"/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2452\">GFWL</a> matchmaking with <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steamworks</a> for multiplayer.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Double Fine Productions began life in July 2000 when it was birthed by veteran game designer <a href=\"/tim-schafer/3040-2860/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2860\">Tim Schafer</a> following his departure from <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a>, where he was well known for his work on several popular adventure games, such as <a href=\"/the-secret-of-monkey-island/3030-3019/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3019\">The Secret of Monkey Island</a>, <a href=\"/grim-fandango/3030-13230/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13230\">Grim Fandango</a> and <a href=\"/maniac-mansion-day-of-the-tentacle/3030-4372/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4372\">Day of the Tentacle</a>. The company recruited many of Schafer 's former colleagues from his previous projects.</p><p style=\"\">Their first released title was <a href=\"/psychonauts/3030-2906/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2906\">Psychonauts</a>. Although the game was well-received by critics, it sold rather poorly (roughly 120,000 copies) as a result of limited marketing from <a href=\"/majesco-entertainment/3010-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-370\">Majesco</a> and a small budget. The game was regarded by many as a cult hit and earned the young company a dedicated fanbase.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/brutal-legend/3030-20700/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20700\">Brütal Legend</a>, Double Fine's second title, was released on October 19th, 2009. The new title had a comparatively huge marketing campaign thanks to financing from publisher <a href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\">EA</a>, being plugged at MTV's 2009 Video Music Awards and sponsoring the winning team at the 2009 Red Bull Soapbox Race. The game was generally well reviewed by critics, with a Metacritic rating of 82 on Xbox 360, and a rating of 83 on the Playstation 3. The game sold much better than Psychonauts, selling 1.1 million copies across all platforms.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, because of the fairly high cost to produce the game, Brütal Legend's 1.1 million copies were still somewhat disappointing. As a reaction to the relatively low payoff for such a big-budget project, Double Fine announced in August of 2010 that going forward they would develop multiple smaller games concurrently for eventual digital release on consoles.</p><p style=\"\">Tim Schafer said that the target would be to work on four games at any given time, with one being a major retail release, and three being smaller download-only projects.</p><p style=\"\">The first downloadable game announced was <a href=\"/costume-quest/3030-32304/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32304\">Costume Quest</a>, helmed by former <i>Brütal Legend</i> lead-animator <a href=\"/tasha-harris/3040-97283/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97283\">Tasha Harris</a>. The game is the first by Double Fine to be created for digital release, as well as the first project at Double Fine led by someone other than Tim Schafer.</p><p style=\"\">While everyone at Double Fine helps create their download-only games, the majority of work on each project is done by relatively small teams within Double Fine, so that multiple projects can be in production at once. This differs from Psychonauts and Brütal Legend, which both involved the entirety of the developer for the full length of the projects.</p><p style=\"\">In late September 2010 it was revealed that Double Fine had hired Tim Schafer's long-time friend and former colleague <a href=\"/ron-gilbert/3040-2859/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2859\">Ron Gilbert</a> to lead development on a new downloadable game. Like Schafer, Gilbert made his name creating visually unique, humorous, character-driven adventure games (with both men working together on the first two <a href=\"/monkey-island/3025-548/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-548\">Monkey Island</a> games).</p><p style=\"\">Double Fine revealed their second downloadable title, <a href=\"/stacking/3030-33251/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33251\">Stacking</a>, on November 23, 2010. Stacking is a puzzle game featuring characters that look a lot like Russian matroshka dolls, and set in the 1930s.</p><p style=\"\">The third downloadable title by Double Fine, <a href=\"/trenched/3030-34304/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34304\">Trenched</a>, was released on June 22, 2011. It features a mix of mech combat and tower defense style gameplay.</p><p style=\"\">On February 8th 2012, Double Fine announced a new, untitled adventure game that would be funded on Kickstarter. Schafer stated it as a way to remove publishers from helping fund the game as the adventure game genre is all but dead. Instead, Schafer hopes that enough fans of old school adventures games will rally enough money to get the new game funded. The project met its $400,000 budget in approximately 8 hours and within 24 hours would become Kickstarters fastest growing and highest funded project to date. This game would later be named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/broken-age/3030-37448/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37448\">Broken Age</a>.</p><h2>Awards</h2><ul><li>2005 “Best Action / Adventure Game” for Psychonauts from <i>Official XBOX Magazine</i></li><li>2005 “Game of the Year” for Psychonauts from <i>Eurogamer</i></li><li>2006 \"Best New Studio\" for Double Fine Productions, Inc., from the Game Developers Conference</li><li>2009 \"Best Strategy / Simulation Game\" for Brütal Legend from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences</li><li>2009 \"Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack\" for Brütal Legend from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences</li><li>2011 \"Developer of the Year\" from <i>Official XBOX Magazine</i></li></ul><h2>Double Fine Presents</h2><p style=\"\">Double Fine Presents is the company's publishing initiative where they partner with other independent developers to offer advice, marketing and assistance in bringing their game to release.

Unfortunately, the sign has been replaced and no longer features any mention of a \"Double Fine.\"</p><h2>Double Fine Action News</h2><p style=\"\">Double Fine Action News is the name of Double Fine's blog. It is written by Tim Schafer and generally acts as his personal blog rather than a marketing outlet. (For example: multiple posts are devoted to an ordeal involving Schafer's discovery of a weevil in his Kashi Instant Oatmeal.) The header image changes periodically and generally features one image mirrored to create two.</p><h2>Double Fine Action Comics</h2><p style=\"\">Double Fine Action Comics are seven web comics created by five Double Fine artists and one senior producer, hosted on the official Double Fine website. Artists Scott Campbell, Nathan Stapley, Mark Hamer, and Tasha Harris each have their own unique series, while Razmig \"Raz\" Mavlian has two. Gabe Miller, the senior producer at Double Fine, is the most recent addition to the lineup.</p><p style=\"\">Currently, Scott Campbell, Nathan Stapley, Tasha Harris, and Gabe Miller add new comics once or twice every week or so. Scott Campbell's comic has over 700 entries so far, Nathan Stapley's has over 400, and Tasha Harris's comic has well over 200 submissions.</p><p style=\"\">In the summer of 2009, Scott C.'s first 300 comic strips were compiled into <i>Double Fine Action Comics, Vol. 1</i>, a book sold through the Double Fine Shop.</p><h2>Double Fine Shop</h2><p style=\"\">The official Double Fine website also hosts the Double Fine Shop. The Double Fine Shop sells many exclusive items related to both Double Fine games and Double Fine Action Comics. Of particular note are various items hand signed by Tim Schafer.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The mascot featured in the studio's logo is known as 2-Headed Baby, often shortened by employees and fans to \"2HB.\"</li><li>Psychonauts is almost always referred to as \"Excellent Game Psychonauts\" throughout the Double Fine website.</li></ul>"

Radical Entertainment went on develop such games as The Simpsons Road Rage, The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run, Hulk, Tetris World, Mario is Missing!, and more until 2005, when they were acquired by Vivendi Games as part of Sierra Entertainment. Radical developed their first game as part of Sierra later that year, Crash Tag Team Racing, taking over the Crash Bandicoot series from Vicarious Visions. In the same year as Crash Tag Team Racing, Radical released The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, Radical's second game based on The Incredible Hulk franchise. The next year, Radical released Scarface: The World Is Yours, the first Scarface video game to date. The World Is Yours received a fairly favorable reaction from critics and was a huge success, selling over 2.5 million copies to date. The next year, Radical released their first true entry in the Crash Bandicoot series, Crash of the Titans, the game received a rather lukewarm reaction. They went on to develop Prototype and Prototype 2 in 2009 and 2012 respectively.</p><p style=\"\">Radical has been confirmed to be closed in June of 2012 via a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rbridgett/status/218417068201095169\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweet</a> from audio engineer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-57384\" href=\"/rob-bridgett/3040-57384/\" slug=\"rob-bridgett\">Rob Bridgett</a></p><h2>Games</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-8118\" href=\"/the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends/3030-8118/\" slug=\"the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends\">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends</a> (1992)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-10713\" href=\"/the-terminator/3030-10713/\" slug=\"the-terminator\">The Terminator</a> (1992)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-14255\" href=\"/the-battle-of-olympus/3030-14255/\" slug=\"the-battle-of-olympus\">The Battle of Olympus</a> (1993)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-5443\" href=\"/mario-is-missing/3030-5443/\" slug=\"mario-is-missing\">Mario is Missing</a> (1993)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-21523\" href=\"/pele/3005-21523/\" slug=\"pele\">Pele!</a> (1993)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-32267\" href=\"/waynes-world/3030-32267/\" slug=\"waynes-world\">Wayne's World</a> (1993)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-5173\" href=\"/bebes-kids/3030-5173/\" slug=\"bebes-kids\">Bebe's Kids</a> (1994)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-18248\" href=\"/beavis-and-butt-head/3030-18248/\" slug=\"beavis-and-butt-head\">Beavis and Butt-head</a> (1994)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-7067\" href=\"/marios-time-machine/3030-7067/\" slug=\"marios-time-machine\">Mario's Time Machine</a> (1994)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-12028\" href=\"/pele-ii-world-tournament-soccer/3030-12028/\" slug=\"pele-ii-world-tournament-soccer\">Pele II: World Soccer Tournament</a> (1994)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-31005\" href=\"/al-unser-jrs-road-to-the-top/3030-31005/\" slug=\"al-unser-jrs-road-to-the-top\">Al Unser Jr.'s Road to the Top</a> (1994)</li><li>Mountain Bike Rally (1994)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-18983\" href=\"/speed-racer-in-my-most-dangerous-adventures/3030-18983/\" slug=\"speed-racer-in-my-most-dangerous-adventures\">Speed Racer in My Most Dangerous Adventures</a> (1994)</li><li>Bret Hull Hockey '95 (1995)</li><li>The Divide: Enemies Within (1996)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-34760\" href=\"/grid-runner/3030-34760/\" slug=\"grid-runner\">Grid Runner</a> (1996)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-7575\" href=\"/nhl-powerplay-96/3030-7575/\" slug=\"nhl-powerplay-96\">NHL Powerplay '96</a> (1996)</li><li>Power Piggs of the Dark Age (1996)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-4589\" href=\"/independence-day/3030-4589/\" slug=\"independence-day\">Independence Day</a> (1997)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-24422\" href=\"/nhl-powerplay-98/3030-24422/\" slug=\"nhl-powerplay-98\">NHL Powerplay '98</a> (1997)</li><li>ESPN X Games Pro Boarder (1998)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-3901\" href=\"/bloodlines/3030-3901/\" slug=\"bloodlines\">Bloodlines</a> (1999)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-21727\" href=\"/mtv-sports-snowboarding/3030-21727/\" slug=\"mtv-sports-snowboarding\">MTV Sports: Snowboarding</a> (1999)</li><li>NBA Basketball 2000 (1999)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-17277\" href=\"/jackie-chans-stuntmaster/3030-17277/\" slug=\"jackie-chans-stuntmaster\">Jackie Chan Stuntmaster</a> (2000)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27633\" href=\"/mtv-sports-pure-ride/3030-27633/\" slug=\"mtv-sports-pure-ride\">MTV Sports: Pure Ride</a> (2000)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-17801\" href=\"/dark-summit/3030-17801/\" slug=\"dark-summit\">Dark Summit</a> (2001)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-17855\" href=\"/the-simpsons-road-rage/3030-17855/\" slug=\"the-simpsons-road-rage\">The Simpsons: Road Rage</a> (2001)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-14116\" href=\"/tetris-worlds/3030-14116/\" slug=\"tetris-worlds\">Tetris Worlds</a> (2002)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-27797\" href=\"/monsters-inc-scream-arena/3030-27797/\" slug=\"monsters-inc-scream-arena\">Monsters, Inc.

    "description": "<h2>Company History</h2><p style=\"\">Although many people have recently started hearing of WayForward thanks to games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4237\" href=\"/contra-4/3030-4237/\">Contra 4</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35901\" href=\"/aliens-infestation/3030-35901/\">Aliens Infestation</a>, the company was actually founded in 1990, with the primary goal of developing games for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\">Super Nintendo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-6\" href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\">Genesis</a>. Soon after starting the company, they began to branch out into educational games for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a> as well. This side of their business quickly took off, and soon they had signed a deal with American Education Publishing to produce more of these games, largely focusing on licensed properties that children would recognize. The company was recognized with awards for innovation at CES, and because of this success they were able to continue down the same path, focusing on properties such as <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1064\" href=\"/muppets/3025-1064/\">The Muppets</a> for their educational games and more mature properties such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22078\" href=\"/the-scorpion-king-rise-of-the-akkadian/3030-22078/\">The Scorpion King</a> for their core games.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1258346-shant01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258346\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1258346-shant01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258346\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17172/1258346-shant01.png\"></a><figcaption>A screen from Shantae on the GBC</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">By hiring their services out to other publishers and developers, WayForward were able to keep up a steady workflow even when they didn't have any projects that they were working on internally. Finally, in 2002, WayForward released their own IP for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-57\" href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\">Game Boy Color</a> called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19245\" href=\"/shantae/3030-19245/\">Shantae</a>. The platformer received all round critical acclaim but the Game Boy Color was at the end of its life and was being replaced at stores in favor of the newer <a data-ref-id=\"3045-4\" href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\">Game Boy Advance</a>, which resulted in poor sales for the title. WayForward continued to work on licensed games for the following few years, using the income generated to compensate for the lack of consumer interest in Shantae.</p><p style=\"\">Years later, when Nintendo announced their new <a data-ref-id=\"3045-52\" href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\">DS</a> handheld, WayForward began to think about revisiting Shantae. They created numerous assets for the game, but couldn't secure a publisher. All of the assets created for the new game were rendered useless; they can often be seen in the test builds of many of WayForward's other games from the time, used as placeholder art until the final artwork is done. Again, recuperating from the rejection of their IP, the company continued to take on licensed titles. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\">THQ</a> contacted them in 2004 to make a chat-based game for the DS called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3853\" href=\"/ping-pals/3030-3853/\">Ping Pals</a>, which would function much like the DS's built-in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27733\" href=\"/pictochat/3030-27733/\">Pictochat</a> but with new features and avatars. WayForward accepted, if only to aquire some DS dev kits, and rushed the \"game\" out to a harsh critical reception.</p><p style=\"\">After this initial blunder, WayForward went on to create some surprisingly well-received licensed games. They first developed and produced <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17817\" href=\"/justice-league-heroes-the-flash/3030-17817/\">Justice League Heroes: The Flash</a> for the GBA in 2006 as the platform began to die out. The game was met with mostly positive reviews. Following that came <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20536\" href=\"/looney-tunes-duck-amuck/3030-20536/\">Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck</a> for the DS, which was met with average review scores. Their big break came in the form of Contra 4 for the DS, though. Seeing the studio's success on handheld platforms, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\">Konami</a> hired them to create a new 2D <a data-ref-id=\"3025-605\" href=\"/contra/3025-605/\">Contra</a> game for Nintendo's successful new platform. Upon its release it 2007, Contra 4 was showered with positive reviews and WayForward was thrust into the spotlight.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/915397-a_boy_and_his_blob_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915397\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 600px\" data-ratio=\"0.725\" data-width=\"600\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/915397-a_boy_and_his_blob_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915397\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3017/915397-a_boy_and_his_blob_10.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A Boy and His Blob for the Nintendo Wii</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Since then, they've become famous amongst fans of 2D gaming, particularly platformers, for their gorgeous 2D animations and smooth gameplay. They continued to take on licensed properties, developing handheld versions of games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26823\" href=\"/where-the-wild-things-are/3030-26823/\">Where The Wild Things Are</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30105\" href=\"/batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-the-videogame/3030-30105/\">Batman: The Brave And The Bold</a>, but their work began to take on a more consistant level of quality. WayForward games are almost exclusively in 2D, and are renowned for their crisp and fluid animations. In 2009 they were hired to revamp <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25508\" href=\"/a-boy-and-his-blob/3030-25508/\">A Boy and His Blob</a>, which was then released for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\">Nintendo Wii</a>. The game was praised for its fantastic artwork, reminiscent of a weekend cartoon. Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis said that it was 'a charming all-ages affair that one ups the game it's based on in virtually every conceivable way.' In his review and awarded it 4/5 stars.</p><p style=\"\">Since then, they've developed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34625\" href=\"/bloodrayne-betrayal/3030-34625/\">Bloodrayne Betrayal</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\">XBLA</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2623\" href=\"/playstation-network/3015-2623/\">PSN</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35901\" href=\"/aliens-infestation/3030-35901/\">Aliens Infestation</a> for the DS. The former, like A Boy and His Blob, garnered much of its attention for its stunning 2D graphics, while the latter, still impressive looking on the DS, has received praised for its resemblance to Nintendo's beloved <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\">Metroid</a> franchise, as well as its stringent use of lives. Between Bloodrayne, Contra 4, and Aliens Infestation, many have said WayForward has begun to garner a reputation for crafting difficult games in the style of older <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\">NES</a> or SNES games. This would be a fair comparison, as clearly the company has a certain fondness for the era in which they started working with games.</p><p style=\"\">Thanks to the advent of downloadable games, and marketplaces such as Nintendo's <a data-ref-id=\"3045-106\" href=\"/dsiware/3045-106/\">DSiWare</a>, WayForward was finally able to give their original IP Shantae new life. In 2010, WayForward finally released the Shantae game they had been dreaming of making since the DS was announced: <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28141\" href=\"/shantae-riskys-revenge/3030-28141/\">Shantae: Risky's Revenge</a>. The low cost of publishing on DSiWare allowed the company to put the game out without worrying about low sales figures or unreceptive publishers. Like it predecessor, the game was released to widespread critical acclaim, continuing the developer's trend of highly regarded platformers. In 2011, the company later went on to release <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28141\" href=\"/shantae-riskys-revenge/3030-28141/\">Shantae: Risky's Revenge</a> on the iOS market. The interface and controls were updated to work better with apple devices.</p><p style=\"\">In March 2012, Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time, announced he would be working with WayForward to develop a Nintendo DS game based on the show.</p>"

The developer was a merge between 3 separate Dutch developers including Orange Games and Digital Infinity. They focused on developing games for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. The four games Lost Boys Games developed are: Tiny Toon Adventures: Dizzy's Candy Quest (2001), Rhino Rumble (2002), Black Belt Challange (2002) and Invader (2002).In 2003, Lost Boys Games was sold to Media Republic, a media venture owned by Lost Boys' founder Michiel Mol. In July of 2003 it was renamed to it's current: Guerilla Games. It began development on <a href=\"/killzone/3030-15048/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15048\">Killzone</a> (Sony Computer Entertainment, PS2) and <a href=\"/shellshock-nam-67/3030-15172/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15172\">Shellshock: Nam '67</a> (Eidos Interactive, PS2, PC &amp; Xbox). Both games were released in 2004. Shellshock sold over 900.000 copies but recieved bad review scores. Killzone went to sell over a million copies worldwide causing it to recieve a lot of media coverage. Thanks to the succes, Guerilla Games made an agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment for future development of the Killzone franchise exclusively for Sony platforms.</p><p style=\"\">In December 2005, Sony Computer Entertainment announced the acquisition of Guerilla Games from parent company Media Republic, making it a wholly owned first party studio.

Published by <a href=\"/eidos-interactive/3010-658/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-658\">Eidos Interactive</a>, this first person shooter was given average ratings because it was said to be repetitive while not breaking any new ground in the genre.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For their next project, Rocksteady chose to tackle a video game version of Batman using the license from the DC comic books. With their publisher Eidos Interactive in financial trouble and the bleak history of Batman video games in the past, this news was met with some skepticism. An article in the magazine Game Informer shortly afterwords got fans and critics excited with this bold, new look for a Batman game. News steadily trickled out of the studio from their website and the gaming press on the game's progress throughout the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Early in 2009 it was revealed that cash strapped publisher Eidos was to be acquired by Japanese publisher <a href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square Enix</a>. Rocksteady assured everyone that Batman was on schedule for its targeted release date of June 23, 2009. However, at the E3 event in May, the news that Batman would be delayed until \"later this summer\" was revealed. Rocksteady kept the buzz alive surrounding Batman with a steady stream of new gameplay videos on its official website along with screenshots and team interviews elsewhere on the web. Batman was finally released on its new scheduled date of August 23, 2009. The game so far has received high marks from all reviewers giving Rocksteady much deserved credit for a great rebirth of the Batman franchise in video games, similar to what Christopher Nolan's films have done for the Batman movies.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On December 12, 2009, at the <a href=\"/spike-video-game-awards/3015-5557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5557\">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, <a href=\"/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29443\">Batman: Arkham City</a> was teased to open the show.

The game's title was revealed to be <i>The Last Guardian</i>. Sony Computer Entertainment announced at E3 that The Last Guardian is set for a 2010 release. The year 2010 came and went without any word from Team Ico. By 2013 many people believed that the game was doomed to never come out. This wasn't helped when Jack Trenton stated in an interview that the game was \"on hiatus.\" Team Ico quickly responded, stating that the game was still being actively worked on.</p>"

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment has been a rising star in the games publishing community, having published such recent hits as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\">Batman Arkham Asylum</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/\">Mortal Kombat</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32085\" href=\"/bastion/3030-32085/\">Bastion</a>. But they weren't always such a major player in the industry; in fact, their presence was relatively minor until around 2007.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2270/516240-batman_forever_0007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-516240\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 960px\" data-ratio=\"0.76015625\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2270/516240-batman_forever_0007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-516240\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2270/516240-batman_forever_0007.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Batman Forever</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Warner Bros. Interactive began licensing their properties under their current name around 1995, with the first being <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10020\" href=\"/batman-forever/3030-10020/\">Batman Forever</a>, licensed to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-88\" href=\"/acclaim-entertainment-inc/3010-88/\">Acclaim</a>. They continued to license their most popular properties, such as DC Comics, Looney Tunes, and various Cartoon Network shows, as well as movie licenses, to various companies over a stretch of about eight years. While Warner Bros. had little to no involvement in the development of any of these games, it was a quick and easy way for them to make money on their existing properties while handing development over to more experienced industry veterans.</p><p style=\"\">Only problem was, these industry veterans were often working under harsh deadlines with little support, and the quality of the products being produced as a result of these deals was suffering greatly. In 2003, Warner Bros. co-published <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18376\" href=\"/looney-tunes-back-in-action/3030-18376/\">Looney Tunes: Back In Action</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\">EA</a>. It was their first little experiment with video game publishing. In 2004, Warner Bros. acquired <a data-ref-id=\"3010-864\" href=\"/monolith-productions-inc/3010-864/\">Monolith Productions</a>, developers of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-181\" href=\"/fear/3025-181/\">FEAR</a> franchise. They were slowly taking a more active role in the games industry, tentatively dipping a toe in the water before jumping in. They wanted to see if it was viable for them to make Warner Bros. a household name in gaming, just as it was in other forms of entertainment.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10309/627637-929039_20061002_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627637\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10309/627637-929039_20061002_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627637\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10309/627637-929039_20061002_screen007.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Justice League Heroes</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Under Warner Bros.' guidance, Monolith developed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9124\" href=\"/the-matrix-online/3030-9124/\">The Matrix Online</a>, which was co-published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\">SEGA</a>. Following the game's release, Warner Bros. continued to seek out new partners in the games industry. They bought a 10.3% stake in SCi Entertainment, the owners of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-658\" href=\"/eidos-interactive/3010-658/\">Eidos Interactive</a>, in 2006. Later that year, they published their first game on their own, called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16327\" href=\"/justice-league-heroes/3030-16327/\">Justice League Heroes</a>.</p><p style=\"\">By 2007, Warner Bros. had seen that there was, in fact, a substantial market to be had on consoles, and they wanted their name to be as respected in gaming as it was in film. To this end, they announced a five year plan to expand into the gaming industry. They outlined a plan to acquire more game studios, as well as to create their own internal studios in the Seattle area to ensure quality games were developed. They began their expansion with the acquisition of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7426\" href=\"/tt-games/3010-7426/\">TT Games</a> later that year. TT Games would go on to become an important factor in Warner Bros. growth; they have been developing <a data-ref-id=\"3025-448\" href=\"/lego/3025-448/\">LEGO</a> games under the Warner banner for years now, beginning with the successful <a data-ref-id=\"3025-449\" href=\"/lego-star-wars/3025-449/\">LEGO Star Wars</a> games.</p><p style=\"\">In April of 2008, Warner Bros. increased their stake in Eidos, gaining a total of 35% along with rights to distribution of their games in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Later that year, in December, Warner Bros. again increased their stake in the company, making for a total of 10 million shares and also granting Warner Bros. the rights to distribute any new Tomb Raider films that may have been in production. Warner's romance with Eidos wasn't meant to last, though, as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\">Square Enix</a> stepped in during 2009 and slowly gained control of the company, changing their name to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6492\" href=\"/square-enix-ltd/3010-6492/\">Square Enix Europe</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/817498-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817498\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 953px\" data-ratio=\"0.49108079748164\" data-width=\"953\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/817498-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817498\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/817498-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/817498-2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Also in 2009, Warner Bros. announced that they had acquired <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2328\" href=\"/snowblind-studios/3010-2328/\">Snowblind Studios</a> in an attempt to strengthen their internal development prowess. Later that year, when troubled developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-185\" href=\"/midway-games/3010-185/\">Midway</a> finally went under, Warner Bros. jumped at the opportunity to acquire many of their old assets, including the powerful <a data-ref-id=\"3025-7\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3025-7/\">Mortal Kombat franchise</a> and the then near-completion <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20698\" href=\"/wheelman/3030-20698/\">The Wheelman</a>. Other assets gained included <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11689\" href=\"/joust/3030-11689/\">Joust</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-281\" href=\"/the-suffering/3025-281/\">The Suffering</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-563\" href=\"/blitz-the-league/3025-563/\">Blitz: The League</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-335\" href=\"/spy-hunter/3025-335/\">Spy Hunter</a>, for a total of $49 million, although Warner Bros. has yet to announce anything regarding these properties. Midway had previously worked in conjunction with Warner Bros. on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20449\" href=\"/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe/3030-20449/\">Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe</a>, so the MK acquisition was a natural one. In July 2009, Warner Bros. renamed their MK team to WB Games Chicago, later to be changed again to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2545\" href=\"/netherrealm-studios/3010-2545/\">NetherRealm Studios</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In August 2009, Warner Bros. and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2576\" href=\"/rocksteady-studios-ltd/3010-2576/\">Rocksteady Studios</a> released Batman Arkham Asylum for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\">Xbox 360</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\">PS3</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a>. Due to the stigma associated with licensed games, the industry as a whole was tentatively excited about Arkham Asylum. Its release turned out to be Warner Bros.' biggest hit yet, raking in positive review scores and Game of the Year nominations from dozens of respected sources. Its success was unanticipated and vast. Shortly after, in February 2010, Warner Bros. announced that they had officially acquired Rocksteady Studios as an internal developer.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5578/1520904-gp4_inmotion_tapper06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1520904\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 960px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5578/1520904-gp4_inmotion_tapper06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1520904\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5578/1520904-gp4_inmotion_tapper06.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5578/1520904-gp4_inmotion_tapper06.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Game Party: In Motion</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On March 22, 2010, Warner Bros. announced that they would be opening a new games studio in Quebec, called WB Games Montreal. It has been projected that the studio will grow to over 300 employees by the end of 2015. They are planning on opening another studio in the city soon as well. These Canadian studios will be largely focused on developing games under the DC Comics label. Continuing a long list of acquisitions, Warner Bros. also took <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4883\" href=\"/turbine-inc/3010-4883/\">Turbine</a>, developer of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16511\" href=\"/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/3030-16511/\">Dungeons and Dragons Online</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1574\" href=\"/lord-of-the-rings-online/3025-1574/\">Lord of the Rings Online</a>, under their wing. This was quickly followed by the announcement that Turbine's Lord of the Rings Online would go <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1308\" href=\"/free-to-play/3015-1308/\">free to play</a> in the fall of 2010. Also in 2010, Warner Bros. announced development of a new Mortal Kombat title for PS3 and 360, and a new FEAR title, both eventually to be released in 2011. Finally, to round out 2010, Warner Bros. released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32661\" href=\"/game-party-in-motion/3030-32661/\">Game Party: In Motion</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-340\" href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\">Microsoft</a>'s new <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\">Kinect</a> peripheral.</p><p style=\"\">2011 is set to be another big year for Warner Bros. Interactive. They released the Mortal Kombat reboot on April 19 to critical acclaim and high sales, especially high for a fighting game. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30484\" href=\"/fear-3/3030-30484/\">FEAR 3</a> was released on June 21, and although it received mixed reviews, it was still moderately successful.

    "description": "<p style=\"\">DICE is a Swedish-based development company, founded in 1988. In the early years of the company, DICE developed pinball games for the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a> home computer and multiple racing games. DICE is probably most well known for their <a href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-51\">Battlefield</a> franchise - <a href=\"/battlefield-1942/3030-12716/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12716\">Battlefield 1942</a> being the first game in the franchise.</p><h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">DICE got its start in 1988 as a demo group, The Silents, in the dorm rooms at Växjö University. Its four founding members were <a href=\"/andreas-axelsson/3040-856/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-856\">Andreas Axelsson</a>, <a href=\"/olof-gustafsson/3040-857/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-857\">Olof Gustafsson</a>, <a href=\"/ulf-mandorff/3040-861/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-861\">Ulf Mandorff</a> and <a href=\"/fredrik-liliegren/3040-859/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-859\">Fredrik Liliegren</a>. The company was first registered under the name Digital Illusions HB in May of 1992, which was subsequently changed to its present name Digital Illusions CE AB in Jan. 1993. While still students at the university, they developed popular pinball games for the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a>: <a href=\"/pinball-dreams/3030-6981/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6981\">Pinball Dreams</a>, <a href=\"/pinball-fantasies/3030-12347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12347\">Pinball Fantasies</a> and <a href=\"/pinball-illusions/3030-18470/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18470\">Pinball Illusions</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In 1994, the company expanded sufficiently to warrant opening a new headquarters in Gothenburg. During its early years, DICE produced racing games like <a href=\"/s40-racing/3030-9079/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9079\">S40 Racing</a>, <a href=\"/swedish-touring-car-championship/3030-17724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17724\">STCC</a> &amp; <a href=\"/motorhead/3030-24373/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24373\">Motorhead</a>. Then in 1999, they delved into the military shooter genre with <a href=\"/codename-eagle/3030-18758/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18758\">Codename Eagle</a>, a game which is often seen as a predecessor to Battlefield series. In 1998, they became a listed company on the Stockholm stock exchange.</p><h3>Expansion</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11164/618560-bf1942_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-618560\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.4150943396226\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11164/618560-bf1942_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-618560\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11164/618560-bf1942_front.jpg\"></a><figcaption>1942 was DICE's breakthrough game</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In Jan. 2000, they acquired 100% stake in <i>Refraction Games</i> and eventually moved into their previous office in 2005.

It cemented DICE's stature, and also led to the highly successful <a href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-51\">Battlefield</a> franchise.</p><p style=\"\">In 2004, DICE also bought <a href=\"/trauma-studios/3010-3593/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3593\">Trauma Studios</a>, the developers behind the popular Desert Storm mod for Battlefield 1942. The studio was renamed DICE New York, and helped in the development of <a href=\"/battlefield-2/3030-16866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16866\">Battlefield 2</a>. The team was offered a move to Stockholm to work on <a href=\"/battlefield-2142/3030-17828/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17828\">Battlefield 2142</a> but they declined. The studio was eventually discontinued and most of them went on to form <a href=\"/kaos-studios/3010-6120/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6120\">Kaos Studios</a>, a former subsidiary of <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a>.</p><h3>Electronic Arts Acquisition</h3><p style=\"\">In 2004, <a href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts</a> announced their intent to purchase DICE and bought a 62% stake over the next year. By Oct 2, 2006 their purchase was completed, and DICE became a subsidiary of Electronic Arts. The company name was subsequently changed to EA Digital Illusions CE, though many players still recognize the company as simply DICE.</p><p style=\"\">In 2005, the company moved from Gothenburg, to the ex-Refraction Games' studio in <a href=\"/stockholm/3035-1091/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1091\">Stockholm</a>. This happened shortly before the company was acquired by Electronic Arts.

    "description": "<h2>Early years</h2><p style=\"\">Irrational Games was formed in 1997 by <a href=\"/ken-levine/3040-33273/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33273\">Ken Levine</a>, <a href=\"/jonathan-chey/3040-56115/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-56115\">Jonathan Chey</a>, and <a href=\"/robert-fermier/3040-3748/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3748\">Robert Fermier</a>. Their first project was the single player campaign for <a href=\"/fireteam/3030-9643/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9643\">Fireteam</a>, an isometric shooter by Cyro Interactive. However, this proved to be a false start when Cyro decided to concentrate on the multiplayer aspect and dropped Irrational's project.</p><p style=\"\">Soon after, <a href=\"/paul-neurath/3040-12502/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12502\">Paul Neurath</a>, Head of <a href=\"/looking-glass-studios-inc/3010-2858/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2858\">Looking Glass</a> at the time, contacted them with an opportunity. This eventually led to Irrational's first published product - <a href=\"/system-shock-2/3030-8870/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8870\">System Shock 2</a>. The sequel to the much beloved <a href=\"/system-shock/3030-13948/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13948\">System Shock</a>, was adored by critics for its tense atmosphere, exquisite sound design, and its faithfulness to the original while making drastic improvements. While the critics and fans adored it, the game went largely unnoticed by the larger gaming audience. Ever since, System Shock 2 makes recurring appearances on many \"Greatest Games of All Time\" lists in publications. This reputation for producing high quality, but poorly-selling PC titles would follow Irrational for years, earning them a cult following of fans.</p><p style=\"\">Irrational opened a second studio in Canberra, Australia in 1999. Co founder, <a href=\"/jonathan-chey/3040-56115/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-56115\">Jonathan Chey</a> a native Australian and was in charge of the new studio. Irrational Canberra developed their own superhero IP and released the RPG <a href=\"/freedom-force/3030-6479/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6479\">Freedom Force</a> in 2002. The game was an homage to silver-age comic books and received universal critical approval. Their next two major titles were both sequels in disparate genres: <a href=\"/tribes-vengeance/3030-909/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-909\">Tribes: Vengeance</a> (2004), the final game in the Earthseige sci-fi franchise, and <a href=\"/swat-4/3030-7288/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7288\">SWAT 4</a> (2005), a tactical squad-based first-person shooter. In between, they also managed to squeeze in an expansion pack to Freedom Force in <a href=\"/freedom-force-vs-the-3rd-reich/3030-8894/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8894\">Freedom Force vs the Third Reich</a>.</p><p style=\"\">With the success of SWAT 4, publisher <a href=\"/vivendi-games/3010-6398/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6398\">Vivendi</a> wanted another SWAT game. Creative director Ken Levine didn't want to do another straight forward cop simulator. An existing concept set in the zombie apocalypse that had previously pitched, was then combined with the shooter squad tactics of the SWAT games. Vivendi was willing to go along with the project, but both parties agreed that zombies didn't fit the SWAT franchise. The title of game became Division 9. The project was canceled after the acquisition by Take-Two.</p><h2>Take-Two Acquisition</h2><p style=\"\">On January 9, 2006, <a href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-450\">Take-Two interactive</a> announced that they had purchased Irrational, and would publish their games under the <a href=\"/2k-games/3010-360/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-360\">2K Games</a> label, 2K Boston and 2k Australia. 2K Boston would use the extensive funding from 2K to begin development on <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock</a>: a spiritual successor to System Shock 2. In August, 2007, BioShock was released to critical and commercial success far exceeding any of Irrational's prior titles, thanks in large part to 2K's substantial marketing budget and the greater audience exposure that came with releasing on consoles (Xbox 360 and PS3).</p><p style=\"\">On December 17th 2007, five members of 2K Boston broke off to form a new studio called 2K Marin, who immediately began work on BioShock's sequel, freeing 2K Boston to begin work on another project. A January 10th, 2010, viewing of programmer Shane Matthews's LinkedIn profile showed his current project as \"Project Icarus\" though his profile was made private shortly thereafter.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1248043-irrational_behavior.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248043\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.70208333333333\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1248043-irrational_behavior.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248043\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1248043-irrational_behavior.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new mouthpiece for the folks at Irrational</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On January 8, 2010, 2K Boston announced the return of their previous moniker, Irrational Games. The reason for the renaming was they observed that references made to 2K Boston persistently included \"(formerly Irrational Games)\" which demonstrated the value that the old name still held in people's minds. In celebration of their renaming, Irrational also relaunched their website using the old URL of <a href=\"http://www.irrationalgames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">irrationalgames.com</a> with the goal of using the site to better engage with fans. The site features behind-the-scenes tidbits from old Irrational Titles like <a href=\"/system-shock-2/3030-8870/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8870\">System Shock 2</a>, <a href=\"/freedom-force/3030-6479/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6479\">Freedom Force</a> and <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock</a> as well as insights into the game creation process.</p><p style=\"\">In addition, Ken Levine and Co. started a new podcast named <a href=\"http://irrationalgames.com/insider/irrational-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Irrational Behavior</a> exploring the ideas and inspirations that make them \"tick\".</p><p style=\"\">On March 26th, 2013 Bioshock Infinite (previously known as Project Icarus) was released to massive critical and commercial success. After the team finished working on DLC for the game titled \"Burial at Sea\" (which sees the franchise return to Rapture), Irrational Games closed its doors.</p><h2>Old Message from 2kboston.com</h2><blockquote><p style=\"\">Hey Everyone!</p><p style=\"\">Some of you might remember us as Irrational Games, the studio that brought you titles such as SWAT 4 and Freedom Force.

But without having invested into the Lisa, they wouldn't have been able to pull off the Macintosh.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/821914-macintosh_128k.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-821914\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.125\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/821914-macintosh_128k.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-821914\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7303/821914-macintosh_128k.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7303/821914-macintosh_128k.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Macintosh.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">GUI concepts pioneered in Lisa flowed to the Macintosh computer. In 1984 the Macintosh launched bundled with some full featured Apple developed software, and a more aggressive price of $1995. It was a deal for a computer bundled with speakers, a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a magical operating system. Even with Mac paint and Mac draw the Macintosh's true killer apps was the original Microsoft Office, and Lotus Jazz (Lotus 1-2-3 for the mac). Without the support of Microsoft the Macintosh wouldn't have been a success. The eventual down fall of the Macintosh is that is was difficult to program for. You had to use an object oriented programming code like C instead of a linear code like basic. There where more apps on the DOS platform, and was a major marketing point against the Mac.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/821915-jobs_sculley_bizwk84.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-821915\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3125\" data-width=\"240\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/821915-jobs_sculley_bizwk84.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-821915\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7303/821915-jobs_sculley_bizwk84.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7303/821915-jobs_sculley_bizwk84.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jobs and Sculley</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Steve Jobs, Apples founder and visionary, lost in a power struggle with, then runner of day to day operations, John Sculley. People believe it was over the enormous amount of resources Jobs was pouring into Research and Development, 3 times that of similar companies. At first with Jobs' absence, Apple flourished. They introduced the portable mac in 1989 for a premium, but followed up with a less expensive round 2 called the Powerbook. Which established the modern form and ergonomic layout of the laptop computer. Mac addict claims that 1989-1991 as Apple's first golden years. However after that Apple began to struggle. Apple was spreading itself too thin with a portable device called the Newton and a home video game system called the Pippin. While spreading itself thin Apple didn't pay attention to the Mac business. The Macintosh line was confusing. They had the Quadra Line of computers, the Centris line, and the Performa line, also a whole range of portable computers. Some Apple computers where shipped with lesser quality components, making some configurations unstable. The Apple operating system evolved but was still difficult to program for. Windows was gaining popularity and offered cheaper hardware options.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6891/760942-11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-760942\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.63052631578947\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6891/760942-11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-760942\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6891/760942-11.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6891/760942-11.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mac OS X Leopard</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The leadership at Apple also grew shaky with Jobs' departure. John Sculley tarnished the reputation of Apple and was replaced as CEO by Michael Spinder and then again by Gil Amelio, the layoff king. The Mac OS ceased evolving, due to lack of R&amp;D so in 1996 Amelio did the right thing. He purchased NeXT, a company that developed a more advanced operating system, NeXTSTEP. With that acquisition came Steve Jobs, Apple's original CEO. In 1997 Steve Jobs replaced Gil Amelio as CEO. He ended all projects at Apple other than the Mac. He was forced to borrow money for Microsoft to abandon the failed clone project. Steve announced that the war between Microsoft and apple was over. At this moment Apple was not competing to gain market-share, they competed to become profitable.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1323144-imac.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323144\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.79155672823219\" data-width=\"379\" style=\"width: 379px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1323144-imac.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323144\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7303/1323144-imac.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7303/1323144-imac.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Original iMac</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Upon Steve's return to the company the first project he brought to market was the iMac in 1998. An all in one computer reminiscent of the Original Macintosh. It was one of the first computers to ship with a USB, an Ethernet port, Internet Explorer, and an internal modem. The \"i\" was for internet; internet mac became iMac. It was rumored that Steve originally hated the name. This ushered in new life into Apple, simplifying there line into four categories of computers. The iMac and iBooks were for consumer, While the Powerbook (later Macbook Pro) and the G4 tower (later Mac Pro) where for pros. This simplified line exists at Apple today.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1323169-ilife003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323169\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78807947019868\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1323169-ilife003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323169\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7303/1323169-ilife003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7303/1323169-ilife003.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Digital Hub</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In 2001, Apple launched OSX. OSX was a new operating system with better security and memory management. It had a bumpy road at first with slow launching applications, long startup times, and several bugs. However even at it's worst it was considered by some the most advanced operating system available. Casual software was sparse because programming had be done in Objective C. The Pro apps shined, especially video. When Apple released Final Cut Pro, the professional videographer was committed to the Mac. Apple in the first release of OSX included iLife, \"the center of your digital life.\" This suite of apps include today iMovie, iPhoto, Garage Band, iTunes, iWeb (And at that time iDVD) These were apps designed to make the Mac / OSX the hub of your digital life. Connecting your cameras, video cameras, MP3 players, in simple and easy ways. iLife was the Mac's killer app.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1323163-ipods.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323163\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.68269230769231\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1323163-ipods.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323163\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7303/1323163-ipods.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7303/1323163-ipods.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>iPods</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Later in 2001 Apple released the iPod. A device that changed the music industry forever. Originally it was a hard drive-based MP3 player about the size of a deck of cards that aloud you to carry 1,000 songs in your pocket. This 5gig player for $499. The players purpose was to offer a mobile version of your iTunes library in a simplified interface using the click wheel. Over time the iPod became more affordable and with more storage. The true mass appeal of the device was with the second generation iPod nano that sold for $199. Before then everyone wanted one, after the $199 nano everyone could afford them. Apple doubled it's annual sales in less than a year. Apple is currently the leader in the MP3 player market with a 65%-80% market share depending on units or dollars.</p><p style=\"\">On January 9th 2007, Apple changed the field of consumer electronics again with the release of the iPhone. Apple's \"Jesus phone\" was a smart phone with no buttons, no keyboard just a giant multi touch screen. It made calls, handled email, behaved like an iPod, and it's killer launch app was a full safari browser. It was the internet in your pocket. The phone was exclusive to AT&amp;T and a year later was launched world wide. That same year Apple started the app store, an avenue for third party developers to make applications and distribute them through iTunes. This was a breakthrough moment in cellular computing. Many of these apps are casual games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25709\" href=\"/plants-vs-zombies/3030-25709/\" slug=\"plants-vs-zombies\"> Plants vs Zombies</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25486\" href=\"/zen-bound/3030-25486/\" slug=\"zen-bound\"> zen bound</a>. Consumers have downloaded over 4 billion apps, and the store generates apple over $1billion annually. (Piper Jaffray)</p><p style=\"\">In April of 2010, Apple released the iPad. A tablet computer they claim to be magical and revolutionary. It had early success, selling 300,000 in the first day.</p><p style=\"\">Apple's story follows very much the life of it's founder Steve Jobs, and his insistence on innovation, secrecy and invention. Upon his first departure from the company Apple struggled to innovate, falling stagnant, almost bankrupt. Steve's return brought life back into Apple creating a more profitable company, filled with exciting products, and a devoted following.</p>"

Trip Hawkins arranged a business meeting with Don Valentine (Sequoia Capital) to discuss financing his new business enterprise, Amazin’ Software. December 1982, Seven months later. Hawkins secured US$2 million of venture capital from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and Sevin Rosen Funds. Between September and November, employee headcount rose to 11, including Tim Mott, Bing Gordon, David Maynard, and Steve Hayes. Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital, the company relocated to a San Mateo office that overlooked the San Francisco Airport landing path. Headcount rose rapidly in 1983, including Don Daglow, Richard Hilleman, Stewart Bonn, David Gardner, and Nancy Fong.</p><p style=\"\">In 1983 Hawkins left the company and went on to found the now defunct 3DO corporation.</p><h2>Early sales strategy</h2><p style=\"\">Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers. Combined with the fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands, this made sales growth more challenging. Retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners. Despite this, revenue was $5 million in the first year and $11 million the next Former CEO Larry Probst arrived as Vice President of Sales in November 1984 and helped the company sustain growth into $18 million in its third full year. Teaming with the existing sales staff that included Nancy Smith, David Klein, and David Gardner, Probst built the largest sales force of any American game publisher. This policy of dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better market awareness, key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors.</p><p style=\"\">In December 1986 David Gardner and Mark Lewis moved to the UK to open a European headquarters. Up until that point publishing of Electronic Arts Games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in Europe was handled by Ariolasoft. A small company in Wales was already called Electronic Arts, and until 1997 Electronic Arts in the UK was known legally as EOA, a name derived from its square/circle/triangle logo. The Welsh company ceased trading in 1997 and Electronic Arts acquired the rights to the name.</p><h2>Developer Treatment</h2><p style=\"\">An innovative approach to giving credit to its developers was one of EA's distinctive characteristics in its early days. This characterization was even further reinforced with EA's packaging of most of their games in the \"album co pioneered by EA because Hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling EA routinely referred to their developers as \"artists\" and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous full-page magazine ads. EA also shared lavish profits with their developers, which added to their industry appeal. Because of this novel treatment, EA was able to easily attract the best developers and the developers were usually very happy working for EA.</p><h2>1991-2010</h2><p style=\"\">EA Games is currently headquartered in the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California. Following the departure of Trip Hawkins, Larry Probst took over the reins and led the company to its current size and stature. Probst considered himself a man of principle and has refused to follow the M-rated example set by Take-Two Interactive, whose violent Grand Theft Auto franchise became the dominant brand in many key demographics from 2000 through 2003. As a result, Probst was heavily criticized by Wall Street analysts, who believe that because of this policy, EA's stock price is lower than it should be.] In late March 2005, Electronic Arts issued its first ever mid-quarter profit warning blaming hardware shortages and lower than expected fourth quarter sales.</p><p style=\"\">In 1999 EA approved its first M-rated game, System Shock II for the PC. Probst later changed his overall stance on M-rated games, and now EA has several titles that compete in the M-rated, adult game arena.</p><p style=\"\">In 2004, EA made a multimillion dollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. In addition to the funds, EA staff members have been actively teaching and lecturing at the school. </p><p style=\"\">In 2009, they purchased Facebook social games developer Playfish, whose games include Pet Society and Restaurant City.</p><h2>Studios under the EA Games label</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ea-los-angeles/3010-1382/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1382\"> EA Los Angeles </a></li><li><a href=\"/ea-montreal/3010-5904/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5904\"> EA Montreal</a></li><li><a href=\"/ea-black-box/3010-1639/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1639\"> EA Black Box</a></li><li><a href=\"/ea-phenomic/3010-1297/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1297\"> EA Phenomic</a></li><li><a href=\"/dice/3010-4880/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4880\"> DICE</a></li><li><a href=\"/criterion-games/3010-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-315\"> Criterion Games</a></li><li><a href=\"/visceral-games/3010-121/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-121\"> Visceral Games</a></li></ul>"

    "description": "<h2>Foundation<br/></h2><br/> At the start of 2006, Paddy Sinclair, and a few of the other staff  now at Proper Games, were working for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2222\" href=\"/visual-sciences-ltd/3010-2222/\" slug=\"visual-sciences-ltd\">    Visual Sciences</a>, and were negotiating the idea of setting up an internal business unit dedicated to downloadable games, particularly for  Xbox Live Arcade with then CEO  Tim Christian. They were setting the wheels in motion and getting funding together when Visual Science went into administration, and they began approaching other former colleagues for starting Proper Games.<br/><br/> From day one, they enjoyed the benefit of some independent funding, so some time could be taken to get up and running. Initially there were only seven employees, and operated under the delusion they could make a downloadable game in three months. Their first year was essentially spent developing technology and investigating ways to get to market, but had the luxury of making mistakes internally for educational purposes.<br/><br/> Over the course of two and a half years grew to twelve full time staff members, two contractors and two student placements. They have now partnered with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">    Capcom</a> to publish their debut, sheep-herding alien puzzler, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21142\" href=\"/flock/3030-21142/\" slug=\"flock\"> <i>Flock!</i></a>., and are looking to develop two to three titles concurrently. They also worked on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29287\" href=\"/final-fight-double-impact/3030-29287/\" slug=\"final-fight-double-impact\"> Final Fight: Double Impact</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\"> Capcom</a>, as well as the Downloadable Content for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26790\" href=\"/crackdown-2/3030-26790/\" slug=\"crackdown-2\"> Crackdown 2</a>.<br/><br/> <h2>Philosophy</h2><br/> The aim at Proper Games is quoted as bringing \"the old school arcade values we all grew up loving to the current generation of consoles using their full capabilities to enhance that most important of qualities - fun!\".<br/><br/> They are convinced they want to make different sorts of games to the mass market, and present them on as many different platforms as possible. In the same vein as fellow British developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6318\" href=\"/media-molecule/3010-6318/\" slug=\"media-molecule\">    Media Molecule</a>, they also wish to maintain a culture of no crunch, whilst remaining a small company with no more than 25 people.

When <a href=\"/sony-corporation/3010-3223/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony</a> was first making its foray into video games, it needed development studios. They bought CSG Imagesoft and renamed the studio to Sony Imagesoft. During this period the company developed and published a wide array of games. </p><h2>Sony Interactive Studios America to 989 Studios and Present </h2><p style=\"\">In late 1995 Sony Imagesoft was merged with another of Sony's in-house developers and renamed to Sony Interactive Studios America. In April 1998, Sony renamed the studio yet again to its final moniker, 989 Studios. 989 Studios seemed to act as a catch all for Sony and the label was mostly used for publishing, although they developed many titles including most of Sony's sports games as well as <a href=\"/twisted-metal-iii/3030-4635/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4635\">Twisted Metal III</a> and <a href=\"/twisted-metal-4/3030-10173/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10173\">4</a>. 989 Studios is no longer a development house, instead it was merged with Red Zone Games in 2001 around the launch of the PS2, and became <a href=\"/sce-studios-san-diego/3010-1789/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1789\">SCE Studios San Diego</a>.</p>"

According to the sources, employees were forced to work overtime with no additional pay, were lied to about release dates in order to justify the overtime, and were treated poorly by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-77377\" href=\"/brendan-mcnamara/3040-77377/\" slug=\"brendan-mcnamara\">Brendan McNamara</a>.

Noire publisher <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1194\" href=\"/rockstar-games/3010-1194/\" slug=\"rockstar-games\">Rockstar Games</a>. The notoriously perfectionist publisher had allegedly considered purchasing the studio and bringing its creator more into the fold during the game's development, but development issues and numerous feuds with McNamara led to a fractured relationship in which both studios assumed primary ownership over the game's success.</p><p style=\"\">Because of the bad press the company received over poor working conditions, the company was unable to secure a deal to make a new game forcing them to shut down in October 2011.</p>"

    "description": "<h2><b>Overview</b></h2><p style=\"\">Through their publishing of puzzle games over recent years, Nikoli have helped popularize common puzzle types such as Sudoku and Kakuro around the world. However these two particular puzzles were originally developed in America.</p><p style=\"\">While appearing in many games, Nikoli puzzles have most extensively appeared in conjunction with Hudson Soft on the DS through their 'Puzzle Series' games, and other titles such as Illustlogic. However, these have not been published outside of Japan.</p><p style=\"\">Nikoli have also been responsible for developing several kinds of original puzzles which have appeared in game form, and believe the worldwide success of their puzzles is largely due to their language independence, featuring universal concepts and only numbers, not letters.</p><p style=\"\">Some notable example of Nikoli's own puzzle types:</p><p style=\"\"><b>Slitherlink</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535850-slitherlink.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535850\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99583333333333\" data-width=\"240\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535850-slitherlink.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535850\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5972/1535850-slitherlink.gif\"></a><figcaption>A single loop</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Probably the most recognised of Nikoli's puzzles, Slitherlink requires the player to draw a path onto a grid filled with various 'number clues'. Numbers indicate the number of sides of that square which form part of the path.</p><p style=\"\">The finished pathway has to form a single closed loop. Consequently, the logic of the game involves avoiding a path that splits, reaches a dead end, or forms two or more loops.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Akari</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535867-akari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535867\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"236\" style=\"width: 236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535867-akari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535867\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5972/1535867-akari.jpg\"></a><figcaption>All lit up!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Also known in the west as Light Up, Akari is one of the simpler puzzle types. Akari starts with a Crossword style grid with several squares blocked out. The aim of the game is to place 'lights' around the grid, which illuminate squares in that row or column, unless blocked by a filled square.</p><p style=\"\">Numbers on some squares indicate how many lights should be in the adjacent four squares. A correctly solved puzzle should have all squares lit, and no two lights should illuminate each other.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Hitori</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535852-hitori.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535852\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"228\" style=\"width: 228px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535852-hitori.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535852\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5972/1535852-hitori.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5972/1535852-hitori.gif\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A finished puzzle</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Like Sudoku, Hitori is about a square grid full of numbers. However, Hitori is almost the opposite of Sudoku, as it starts with a full grid, and numbers must be removed. The aim of the puzzle is to block out squares, so that no row or column contains more than one of any number.</p><p style=\"\">The other conditon of the game is that all remaining numbers should connect to each other (not counting diagonally). Tradtionally, numbers are circled when they are confirmed as required.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Nurikabe</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535851-nurikabe.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535851\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"226\" style=\"width: 226px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5972/1535851-nurikabe.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535851\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5972/1535851-nurikabe.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5972/1535851-nurikabe.gif\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Walls and Groups</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Conceptually one of Nikoli's more complicated puzzles, Nurikabe is named after a 'wall demon' from Japanese folklore. Playable on a grid of any size, the aim is to use the initial number clues to construct a wall pattern which partitions the remaining squares into groups.</p><p style=\"\">The size of each group must equal the number on a square within it. The player must therefore avoid groups which have no number, or more than one number. Similar to Hitori, the 'wall' must exist as one continuous structure, and additionally not contain any 2x2 squares.</p><p style=\"\">Other puzzle types featuring in Nikoli publications include Numberlink, Fillomino, Ripple Effect and Hashiwokakero.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p style=\"\">Nikoli is named after a race horse.</p>"

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Founded in Manchester, England  Ocean Software, also known as Ocean of America in the United States, developed and published games for gaming systems such as<a data-ref-id=\"3045-16\" href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16/\" slug=\"zx-spectrum\">                                                            ZX Spectrum</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-14\" href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" slug=\"commodore-64\">                                                          Commodore 64</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-11\" href=\"/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/\" slug=\"amstrad-cpc\">                                                         Amstrad CPC</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-13\" href=\"/atari-st/3045-13/\" slug=\"atari-st\">                                                        Atari ST</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-1\" href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" slug=\"amiga\">                                                       Amiga</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" slug=\"pc\">                                                      PC</a>, and later consoles including <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">                                                     Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" slug=\"snes\">                                                    Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-8\" href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" slug=\"sega-master-system\">                                                   Sega  Master System</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-6\" href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" slug=\"genesis\">                                                  Sega Mega Drive</a>.   <br/> <br/>Ocean Software began by buying many Television and Movie licenses for their video games, which although were not well received by critics, were huge financial successes. This enabled Ocean Software to fund original game developments and purchase many arcade conversion licenses and make ports for other gaming platforms. Ocean did receive positive reviews for some movie licensed games such as<a data-ref-id=\"3030-16034\" href=\"/batman-the-movie/3030-16034/\" slug=\"batman-the-movie\">                                                Batman The Movie </a>(1989), <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21323\" href=\"/robocop/3030-21323/\" slug=\"robocop\">                                               RoboCop</a> (1988), and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3173\" href=\"/robocop-3/3030-3173/\" slug=\"robocop-3\">                                             Robocop 3</a> (1992), which featured 3D graphics in 16-bit versions.  <br/> <br/>With the decrease in popularity of the Spectrum and Amiga and the introduction of new console systems such as the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, Ocean Software went through a transition phase getting to grips with the new technology. This lead to fewer titles being developed and subsequently the purchase by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-548\" href=\"/atari-sa/3010-548/\" slug=\"atari-sa\">                                           Infogrames UK </a>in 1998 in a deal worth $100 million. <br/> <br/><h2>Ocean Loader</h2> Ocean loader introduced the concept of loading screens to 8-bit platform gaming.  Traditionally games would take several minutes to load from cassette with on form of display or sound. This changed when Ocean Loader was first introduced in games for the Commodore 64. Now during loading a picture representing the game was displayed on TV screens while music played in the background. Five versions of background music themes were produced and were composed by different people. <br/> <br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Versions 1 &amp; 2 - Composed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-5357\" href=\"/martin-galway/3040-5357/\" slug=\"martin-galway\">        Martin Galway</a></li><li>Version 3 - Composed by Peter Clake</li><li>Versions 4 &amp; 5 - Composed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-16075\" href=\"/jonathan-dunn/3040-16075/\" slug=\"jonathan-dunn\">       Jonathan Dunn</a><br/></li></ul> <br/>Ocean Loader was written by in-house games programmer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-10357\" href=\"/bill-barna/3040-10357/\" slug=\"bill-barna\">     Bill Barna</a> and the first game to implement Ocean Loader coding was <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5590\" href=\"/hyper-sports/3030-5590/\" slug=\"hyper-sports\">      Hyper Sports</a>.  From 1987 onwards Ocean Loader was replaced by Freeload written by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-7958\" href=\"/paul-hughes/3040-7958/\" slug=\"paul-hughes\">    Paul Hughes</a>. <br/>  <br/><h2>History </h2><br/><h3>1983</h3>Founded by David Ward and John Woods, initially called Spectrum Software, Ocean Software began as a publisher hiring many outside programmers and development teams. The companies first releases included Digger Dan, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12968\" href=\"/daley-thompsons-decathlon/3030-12968/\" slug=\"daley-thompsons-decathlon\">                                      Daley Thompson’s Decathlon</a>, HighNoon, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5289\" href=\"/mr-wimpy-the-hamburger-game/3030-5289/\" slug=\"mr-wimpy-the-hamburger-game\">                                     Mr Wimpy: The Hamburger Game</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18931\" href=\"/hunchback-ii-quasimodos-revenge/3030-18931/\" slug=\"hunchback-ii-quasimodos-revenge\">                                       Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge</a>.  <br/><br/><h3>  1984</h3>Purchased rival software studio, Imagine which was based in Liverpool. This allowed Ocean to start developing in-house games and also enabled self publication of games.  Ocean later struck a deal with  <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" slug=\"konami-corporation\">   Konami</a> to publish their arcade games such as Hypersports, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18147\" href=\"/ping-pong/3030-18147/\" slug=\"ping-pong\">                                  Ping Pong</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7992\" href=\"/kung-fu/3030-7992/\" slug=\"kung-fu\">                                   Kung Fu</a> using the Imagine brand.<br/>  <h3>1985 </h3> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1340236-1261_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340236\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4357142857143\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1340236-1261_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340236\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57793/1340236-1261_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Rambo</figcaption></figure>Ocean began developing and publishing its first Movie licensed games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24089\" href=\"/rambo/3030-24089/\" slug=\"rambo\">                      Rambo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6624\" href=\"/short-circuit/3030-6624/\" slug=\"short-circuit\">                     Short Circuit</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5700\" href=\"/cobra/3030-5700/\" slug=\"cobra\">                    Cobra</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9003\" href=\"/frankie-goes-to-hollywood/3030-9003/\" slug=\"frankie-goes-to-hollywood\">                   Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>, some becoming classics such as Batman, Wizball among many others.

Their headquarters are located in Kungbacka, Sweden. <br/> <br/><h2>History</h2>Bergsala was founded in Kungsbacka, Sweden by Owe Bergsten, Pierre Sandsten and Lars-Göran Larsson in 1976. The name \"Bergsala\" is a combination of the three founders surnames. During the first years, Bergsten and Larsson imported electronic products that were sold in a small store in Kungsbacka. <br/> <br/>In 1981, during a trip to the far east, Owe Bergsten purchases a portable game to keep himself occupied during the flight home. The game was a title in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1183\" href=\"/game-watch/3025-1183/\" slug=\"game-watch\">Game &amp; Watch</a> series of products called Fire. The three owners thought that the product had potential, and contacted Nintendo via telex to investigate the possibilities to distribute Game &amp; Watch in Sweden. After some time, Nintendo replied that the company Alga AB owned the rights to distribute Nintendos products in Sweden. <br/> <br/>Before long, Bergsala notices that Alga didn't intend to import any Game &amp; Watch products in Sweden. Because of that, Owe Bergsten decided to travel to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1372\" href=\"/kyoto/3035-1372/\" slug=\"kyoto\">Kyoto</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-37\" href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" slug=\"japan\">Japan</a> to convince Nintendo to give them a shot. Nintendo accepts. Several months passed before Bergsala managed to get their first order för Game &amp; Watch, but after that, the interest for the strange series of portable games started to snowball. Bergsala ordered more copies, and before long, they managed to convince Nintendo to make them responsible for the distribution of Nintendo products in Norway, Finland and Denmark as well. <br/> <br/>The money from Game &amp; Watch enabled Bergsala to import more products from other manufacturers, none of them video game related. In 1983-1984, the combination of shrinking Game &amp; Watch sales and a number of failed ventures resulted in severe financial problems for the company. At the same time, Nintendo begins to unveil their new console, the Nintendo <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">Family Computer</a>, for business partners. Bergsala tried to convince Nintendo to let them release the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">Famicom</a> in Sweden, but in the end, Nintendo decided to release it in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\" href=\"/north-america/3035-1664/\" slug=\"north-america\">North America</a> first. Thanks to revenue from sales of other video game systems like the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-76\" href=\"/vectrex/3045-76/\" slug=\"vectrex\">Vectrex</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-51\" href=\"/intellivision/3045-51/\" slug=\"intellivision\">Intellivision</a>, Bergsala managed to keep afloat until the release of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in September 1986. <br/> <br/>After a few months, Bergsala had sold 800,000 <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">NES</a> consoles in a country with 9,000,000 people. Since then, Bergsala has distributed every Nintendo console (except <a data-ref-id=\"3045-79\" href=\"/virtual-boy/3045-79/\" slug=\"virtual-boy\">Virtual Boy</a>) in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway."

    "description": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p style=\"\">BiP media is a development studio comprised of 11 individuals, located in France, who currently primarily develop quality titles for DSiWare. According to their official website, they are also developing for PSN, Mac, Windows and Android. They are perhaps most famous for their My Farm series consisting of the games My Farm, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32605\" href=\"/my-exotic-farm/3030-32605/\" slug=\"my-exotic-farm\">My Exotic Farm</a>, My Asian Farm and the newest in the series, My Australian Farm.</p><h2>Studio Philosophy</h2><p style=\"\">The BiP media studio have their own philosophy when approaching the development of a game. The key points of this philosophy are that BiP believe the video game industry has the power to create both fortune and failure and the real true success stories from the industry are born from the most innovative minds and development teams, thus BiP media strives to be the next <a data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\" href=\"/hideo-kojima/3040-63395/\" slug=\"hideo-kojima\">Hideo Kojima</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a>. It is their passion to create the most entertaining video games as possible and they are meticulous about their work. They enjoy being an independent studio and never wish to live under the control of a dominating publisher, and they will continue to walk the road of uncertainty, developing games for both the hardcore and the casual, platformers and farm simulations.</p><p style=\"\">Above all, BiP media hopes that all the gamers out there have as much fun playing their products as they do making them, and I think that's something we can all raise a glass to.</p><h2>Games Developed</h2><p style=\"\">The following titles have either been developed or are currenty in development by BiP media:</p><ul><li>My Farm</li><li>My Exotic Farm</li><li>My Asian Farm</li><li>My Australian Farm</li><li>Viking Invasion</li><li>Advanced Circuits</li><li>Judge Dee: The City God Case</li><li>Tiny Token Empires</li><li>Hellokids - Vol. 1: Coloring and Painting</li><li>Vampyres in Paris</li></ul>"

They began as a company that ran two rocking horse rides in a department store in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1454\" href=\"/yokohama/3035-1454/\" slug=\"yokohama\">Yokohama</a>, Japan. This eventually expanded to the Tokyo area and in 1959 they changed their name to Nakamura Manufacturing Co., Ltd (<i>Na-M-Co</i>), which would serve as the Namco name. In the 1960s they established their own production facility for constructing rides and continued to operate more elaborate rides. They were also able to acquire a license to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-720\" href=\"/disney/3025-720/\" slug=\"disney\">Disney</a>'s characters for use in them. In 1970, they developed their first coin-operated machine, Racer, a primitive driving simulator. In 1972, the company began use of the Namco name. In 1974, they acquired the struggling Atari Japan for $500,000, giving Namco the exclusive publishing rights to Atari's games in Japan for 10 years. In 1978, they released their first video game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25506\" href=\"/gee-bee/3030-25506/\" slug=\"gee-bee\">Gee-Bee</a>. In the same year, they established Namco America in Sunnyvale, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1719\" href=\"/california/3035-1719/\" slug=\"california\">California</a>, which operated to license Namco's games to American distributors such as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-185\" href=\"/midway-games/3010-185/\" slug=\"midway-games\">Midway Games</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"/atari/3010-182/\" slug=\"atari\">Atari</a>.<br/> <br/>In 1980, they released the monumental <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\" href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624/\" slug=\"pac-man\">Pac-Man</a>. While unpopular in Japan, it saw tremendous success in North America where it was seen as a breath of fresh air in a market filled with sci-fi games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099/\" slug=\"space-invaders\">Space Invaders</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1034\" href=\"/asteroids/3030-1034/\" slug=\"asteroids\">Asteroids</a>. It became a pop culture sensation and went on to sell over 350,000 units. They continued their success with games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1487\" href=\"/xevious/3030-1487/\" slug=\"xevious\">Xevious</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15784\" href=\"/galaga/3030-15784/\" slug=\"galaga\">Galaga</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2587\" href=\"/dig-dug/3030-2587/\" slug=\"dig-dug\">Dig-Dug</a>. In 1984, they began developing titles for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">Nintendo Famicom</a> under the name 'Namcot', which would prove to be a successful venture, eventually accounting for 40% of Namco's revenue. After the Video Game Crash of 1984, which split Atari into two seperate entities, Namco sold off their share of Atari to Warner Communications. By the early 90s, Namco had acquired a string of arcade distributors making it the largest arcade operator in the United States. They also ventured into amusement parks in Japan, establishing Namco Wonder Eggs in 1992 and later Empire of Eggs. In 1996 they merged the two parks, creating Namco Wonder Eggs 2. They also opened large arcades named Wonder Park, Wonder City and Wonder Tower in Sagamihara, Yokohama and Kyoto, respectively. They also continued to have arcade and home console hits such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2158\" href=\"/ridge-racer/3030-2158/\" slug=\"ridge-racer\">Ridge Racer</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15867\" href=\"/time-crisis/3030-15867/\" slug=\"time-crisis\">Time Crisis</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10081\" href=\"/tekken/3030-10081/\" slug=\"tekken\">Tekken</a>. <br/> <br/>In 2003, they offered to merge with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" slug=\"sega\">Sega</a>, which rose Sega's stockprice by 15%, but the offer fell through and Namco withdrew plans after Sammy offered to merge with Sega. In September of 2005, they merged with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-272\" href=\"/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272/\" slug=\"bandai-co-ltd\">Bandai</a> to form Namco Bandai Holdings, and their games development merged to form <a data-ref-id=\"3010-382\" href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" slug=\"namco-bandai-games-inc\">Namco Bandai Games</a>. <br/><h2>Franchises</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25631/1546400-pacman_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1546400\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25631/1546400-pacman_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1546400\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25631/1546400-pacman_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Pac-Man is an icon almost synonymous with video games.</figcaption></figure>     Namco have had a decent amount of successful franchises.
