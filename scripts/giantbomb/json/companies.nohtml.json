    "description": "Electronic Arts is an American developer, publisher, marketer and distributor and is one of the largest video game companies in the world. Trip Hawkins founded the company in 1982 and was a pioneer in the video game industry. When originally formed, EA was a publishing house, but slowly began to develop in-house games such as Skate or Die. EA then began to purchase various developers, quickly becoming one of the largest publishers in the industry.Electronic Arts original logoTrip Hawkins originally created the company as Amazin' Software. Hawkins quickly began filling the roster with former co-workers from Apple. Hawkins had a sales strategy to sell directly to the buyers. This proved difficult because retailers were interested in well-known brands such as Atari. However, Amazin' Software thrived, earning revenue of $11 million. Despite success, many of Amazin' Software's internal employees disliked the name of the company. After several meetings, they had a new name: Electronic Arts. The name change came with other changes and after 9 years as the CEO, Hawkins left Electronic Arts and formed 3DO.After Hawkins departure, Larry Probst filled his position. Probst wanted EA to be lead with principle and integrity and refused to allow EA to publish any M-rated games, which had become more of a mainstay in the industry. This caused problems for EA and the company's stock fell significantly. Probst faced major criticism from the public and investors alike. Under mounting pressure, he eventually changed his stance on M-rated games. EA published its first M-rated game, System Shock 2, in 1999. This change marked a new beginning for EA, historically signaling the company's rise to become one of the prominent and largest publishers in the industry.In 2004, EA purchased the exclusive license of ESPN and the NFL. This was seen as one of the largest deals in video game history. Many gamers felt that the 2K series was of much higher quality than the Madden series and it forced the series on any gamer wanting to play a NFL title. EA would then go on to acquire the exclusive license to NCAA football, furthering expanding their foothold in football. EA capitalized on its licensing deals, instating yearly releases of Madden, FIFA, NHL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and more.In 2007, Probst stepped down from his position as CEO and appointed John Riccitiello to CEO. Under Riccitiello, Electronic Arts would expand further than ever. Riccitiello went on to purchase major game developers, including Mythic Entertainment, Pandemic Studios and BioWare. Riccitiello also made a bid for Take-Two, EA's main competitor. The bid lead to very long series of delays and changes to the deal but was ultimately declined by Take-Two. Critics say it was a bad decision not to accept the deal, as nobody else would offer them a price even close to EA's. Gamers were very pleased with this, as some of their favorite franchises would not be \"lost\" to EA (such as GTA, and Bioshock). If the deal had gone through, the acquisition would have been the largest deal in video game history.On July 31, 2008, Hall of Fame football player Jim Brown sued EA for \"unspecified damages for trademark infringement, unauthorized use of his likeness, trademark dilution and unfair business practices and competition.” Brown's claim was on the \"All-Browns\" team in Electronic Arts' Madden series the running back is African American player wearing the number 32. This player is obviously meant to be Jim Brown. Brown also demanded that his likeness be removed from the game.Electronic Arts had historically been recognized as one of the most hated video game companies in the industry. Many gamers see EA as trying to form a monopoly by acquiring many game developers and publishers. Some also believe once EA acquires a developer, the quality of that studios titles drop due to EA trying to meddle with and milk the franchises owned by these companies. EA also receives criticism because of their yearly installations of their games. Many feel that these games are just very small changes between them and that they are rushed out each year.Starting in late 2007/early 2008 however, EA has earned new respect and recognition from gamers. While still developing and publishing their annual franchises, EA’s focus shifted towards new - and often innovative - IP's. Titles published and developed in 07/08 such as Skate, Mirror's Edge and Dead Space have helped significantly increase EA's reputation among gamers. This, along with deliberately antagonistic comments from Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, has helped lend credence to the phrase \"Activision is the new EA.”Unfortunately, EA has lost many of its PC fans due to its installations of the anti-piracy software SecuROM, though this has backfired, and Spore, a game with plenty of controversy over this security software, became the #1 most pirated game of 2008. In 2012, the company was also awarded the title as the \"Worst Company in America\" by The Consumerist via an online voting ballot.EA's structure consists of four major division called Labels, with each studio owned by EA falling into one of the three Labels. EA Labels is headed by Frank Gibeau. EA Labels consist ofEA GamesEA SportsEA PlayEA has a sub-Label called EA Interactive which consists of studios developing games for the Mobile and Social markets.",

T.HQ, more commonly referred to without the punctuation, was added to the NASDAQ National Market in 1994. Toy Headquarters was founded in 1990 by Jack Friedman with his own money. THQ boasted two early successes in video games, Where’s Waldo and Home Alone, awful titles which succeeded due to the popularity of their source material. THQ acquired its first developer, Black Pearl Software, in 1992.Throughout the mid ‘90s the company fell into financial troubles losing millions of dollars. In 1995, Jack Friedman turned over the company to his CFO, Brian J. Farrell. The first thing Farrell did was fire half the staff, proving his own status as a heartless villain. Next, he increased the number of games the company developed, despite having half the people to work on them. The changes inexplicably worked and THQ’s profits recovered. In 1997, THQ released WCW Vs nWo: World Tour to great success. THQ continued to release licenced games with great success.THQ continued to release a variety of licensed games, including WWE, Spongebob SquarePants, and Warhammer 40,000 games. The studio also began release more non-licensed and critically-acclaimed titles including Saints Row and Darksiders.In late 2010 the company released the Udraw tablet for the Wii game console. The accessory along with the games that supported it were a hit and so the company soon decided to release versions of the tablet for the Xbox 360 and PS3 which sold way below expectations. This led to the company experiencing economic troubles early on in 2012. Events were improved, as the game Saints Row the Third became an unexpected hit for the company. In response to both of these events THQ made the decision to step away from childrens' games almost entirely and instead focus on games aimed towards core gamers.In 2011, THQ decided to release PS3 and Xbox 360 variants of the uDraw tablet, an accessory that had previously sold well for the company on the Wii. However, THQ grossly miscalculated the demand for such an accessory on the other platforms. With the vast majority of the expensive-to-produce tablets left unsold, the company's finances took a hit to the degree that steps were required to prevent falling into bankruptcy and being de-listed from NASDAQ. They cut several in-development projects from their slate, including Devil's Third and inSANE, and turned their focus to core franchise titles such as Darksiders II and a fourth Saints Row entry. THQ studio staff was also affected, with THQ San Diego notably being shut down during the week of E3 2012. Jason Rubin was also brought in to serve as the company's new chief executive.On December 19th, 2012, THQ filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy with intention to sell off the company's assets to venture capital firm Clearlake in order to allow the business to survive. However the deal with Clearlake broke down due to complaints from THQ's various creditors. An auction for other publishers to bid for THQ's properties was announced for January 22.The auction occurred on January 23rd, 2013, where THQ sold off its intellectual properties, and announced liquidation for when the sales transactions are complete. Properties and companies sold in the auction included the selling of studio Relic Entertainment to SEGA for a reported $26m as well as sale of the Saints Row IP alongside developer Volition to Koch Media for an apparent price of $23m.THQ was based out of Agoura Hills, CA with offices in Europe and Asia Pacific.

    "description": "Blaster Master SunSoft was founded in 1971 as a sub-division of Japanese Sun Electronics. They first started developing arcade games and had several successful titles in the early 1980s, one example being Arabian. Console development started around 1985 with games for the Famicom being the main focus. It had already gone international with their arcade games when the NES hit the US and Europe, so they didn't have much trouble securing major licenses like Batman and The Addams Family.Like many other developers at the time, their first Famicom games were ports of their arcade games. The first Famicom game Sunsoft released was in fact Super Arabian. Sunsoft did not enjoy a sterling reputation early on, with many of their games being quick cash-ins of popular Japanese licenses and mahjong games. It wasn't until the late 80s and early 90s that SunSoft's games really started to stand out against the competition.Mr. Gimmick Sunsoft took existing ideas and perfected them. The hardware was pushed to its limits in a lot of their games to produce graphics and sound that were almost unheard of on the NES at the time, and the gameplay and controls were generally tight. This is probably the main reason many of their NES games are now considered classics of the era. Some examples include Blaster Master, Journey to Silius, Mr. Gimmick and Ufouria: The Saga.Sunsoft was also one of few companies aside from Nintendo themselves that actually corrected their games for the PAL market, so the sound and graphics in their games are reproduced correctly in the PAL region as well. Usually companies would just release the NTSC version in the PAL region, not bothering to optimize the games to 50hz, making the games run around 20% slower in the PAL region. It wasn't until the N64 that this became standardized.Ufouria: The Saga But when the company started focusing on developing for the SNES, few of their games stood out as much as their NES games had done, so they didn't garner much interest among audiences. In 1995 they faced bankruptcy and was heavily restructured. A couple of games were later released for the PlayStation and the Game Boy Color.The company has also shown signs of activity recently with Blaster Master released for Wii's Virtual Console service, and more recently Blaster Master: Overdrive, a re-imagining of the first game, on WiiWare.

The company was created as a subsidiary of ASCII Entertainment Software, itself a western branch of the Japanese ASCII Corporation.The majority of Agetec's release catalog is filled with relatively obscure, niche titles such as the RPG Maker series. However, they have on occasion stepped in to publish more noteworthy titles such as Space Channel 5 Special Edition, King of Fighters '99, and several Armored Core titles.The company has become less prolific the 2010s, focusing on smaller downloadable titles on platforms like the 3DS eShop. Their most recent new title announcement was a move into mobile with the iOS version of Kamaitachi no Yoru in 2012, however nothing appears to have come of this and the game was eventually released by Aksys Games instead as Banshee's Last Cry in 2014.",

In 1999, the company became a subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a German publishing company that went public during the dot-com boom. Shortly after Piranha Bytes released their first game, Gothic, in late 2001, Phenomedia went into insolvency proceedings after allegations that several executives had falsified balance sheets, for which several served prison sentences for securities fraud. In response, Piranha Bytes executed a management buyout to sever itself from Phenomedia, changing their name in Pluto 13.In 2007, Piranha Bytes split with its long time publisher, JoWood Productions. In the split, JoWood retained publishing rights to the company's Gothic series, including future releases. This lead to Pluto's next title, Risen, not being a game in the franchise, even though it highly resembles the Gothic series in using the same engine and storytelling mechanics, even to the point of being commonly referred to as Gothic 4.",

Martin Bromely, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert started the company in Honolulu, Hawaii. They created the company to make Coin-op games for US Military Servicemen, who had all this spare time on military bases. Originally the company was named Standard Games, However that was quickly changed to Service Games, and in 1951 Bromely got the idea to move the company to Tokyo, Japan. In May of 1952, a new business name was registered, \"Service Games of Japan\".Two years go by, it's 1954, and another American businessman, David Rosen, is starting up a company in Japan called Rosen Enterprises Inc. The Company was originally created for exporting art, but during Rosen's time in Japan, he noticed a popular phenomenon. People in Japan were really into coin-op instant photo booths! The company changed their ways and started importing and exporting various coin-op games.A flyer for Sega's 1965 coin-op game, Periscope.In 1965, Rosen Enterprises and Service Games merged together, Rosen's name was dropped completely, and Service Games shortened their name to only the first two letters, SE, and GA. The new corporation was named Sega Enterprises, and it was only the beginning for this soon-to-be-huge company. The first game released by Sega Enterprises was another coin-op game called Periscope. The game was a submarine simulator, and was an international hit.Gulf Western bought Sega Enterprises in 1969, but allowed Rosen to stay the CEO of the company. Rosen led the company to prosper even further, creating more and more coin-op games.By 1982, Sega's revenues hit $214 million. The company was growing strong, with the advent of video arcades, and growing demand for the home video game market, Sega released a few new products in Japan in 1983. The first was Subroc-3D, which was an arcade game that utilized two periscope-type devices to view 2D sprites on a 3D plane. Sega also released their first home video game console, the SG-1000, due to the growing home video game market. It Included some popular arcade titles such as Space Invaders, and Sega's own, Zaxxon. Another arcade title they released was Astron-Belt, one of the first games to use laserdisc media. This title would be licensed out to Bally Midway for release in North America.Zaxxon was a very popular arcade title.In 1983, however, Sega was having financial troubles in the U.S., the American video game crash was apparent, and video games were seemingly fading away into obscurity. Gulf Western was pressured by the great crash, and sold all of Sega's U.S. assets off to a company called Bally Manufaturing Corperation, who specialized in making pinball games. All of this prevented the SG-1000, and it's second release from 1984 , the SG-1000 Mark II, from ever being released in the U.S. The Japanese assets of Sega were purchased by a group of investors that included Hayao Nakayama, who owned a distribution company acquired by Rosen back in 1979. Nakayama became the new CEO of Sega of Japan, and Rosen moved back to the U.S. to become the head of Sega's U.S. subsidiary.The Multi-billion dollar Japanese company CSK bought Sega Enterprises in 1984, renamed it Sega Enterprises Ltd., put the HQ in Japan, and by 1986, Sega was trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The chairman of CSK, who was also a friend of Rosen's, Isao Ookawa, became the new chairman of Sega Enterprises Ltd., and things were looking up. in 1985, Sega released the SG-1000 Mark III in Japan. Thanks to the release of the NES, Video games were starting to resurface in the US, and Sega of America was officially established as a business name in 1986.The Sega Master SystemNow that Sega of America was developed, Sega was ready to bring its home game consoles to the US, however, the SG-1000 Mark I wasn't as technically powerful as the Mark III, so in 1986, they re-released the SG-1000 Mark III in the US under the name of the Sega Master System. The system had various titles such as Fantasy Zone, which created their first popular mascot, Opa-Opa. A little later that year, Sega had developed a new mascot to replace Opa-Opa with Alex Kidd. It wasn't actually official if this was their new mascot or not, but due to the popularity of the game, everybody assumed it was. The North American market wasn't enthralled by Sega's console, due to low sales. The major problem was the aggressive advertising strategy Nintendo employed with their console. Even though the Master System was technically superior to the NES, Nintendo was still able to get the upper hand. They already had the Famicom out since 1983 in Japan and the NES since 1985 in the US, so they got the upper hand by having their system out first. The Master System did well in Europe and Brazil, however. It lasted until 1996 in Europe, before it was discontinued, and in Brazil it lasted all the way until 2000. Sega needed something new to appeal to the North American market, however. The answer was the Sega Genesis.Sonic vs. Mario, The Classic BattleComing to store shelves in August of 1989, the Sega Genesis known as the Mega Drive in all other regions besides the US, was a great leap forward from the technology in the Master System. Sega launched ad campaigns that said \"Genesis Does What Nintendon't\". The system had lots of great arcade titles from that time such as Golden Axe, Altered Beast, Mortal Kombat, and Ghouls N' Ghosts made the Mega Drive a great system to play great arcade titles of the time on. Other titles like Earthworm Jim, Ecco the Dolphin, and Gunstar Heroes came eventually and showed that the Mega Drive had a slew of great original content with that same arcade-like style that everybody enjoyed. However, no game spurred more commotion than the 1991 release of Sonic the Hedgehog.The Sega Genesis, the US Region release.Sonic, The little blue hedgehog made his mark on the Genesis, so much that people saw Sonic and Mario as direct competitors. Everybody who grew up around this time must have had some sort of argument in school with their friends at the lunch table. Who was better? Mario or Sonic? That's for everybody to decide on their own, but the two were very evenly matched at the time of the release of the Mega Drive.In 1991, Nintendo released the Super Famicom in Japan, or Super NES in North America (which came to be known as the SNES) as direct competition for the Genesis. It had technically superior software, and a bunch of popular Nintendo franchises being released for it. In 1992 Sega released Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and fans went crazy over the game, Genesis was growing ever more popular, and Sonic 2 was, and still is, the highest selling Sega game ever made, selling 6 million copies as of June 2006. Also in 1992 Sega released the Sega CD (called Mega-CD in all other regions except North America). This was an add-on to the genesis which used CD media which was more powerful and cheaper to produce than the Cartridge. This was a great opportunity for Sega to get the edge on Nintendo. However, with a disappointing game library full of games which were only upgraded ports of previously released games on the Genesis and an obsessive focus on FMV games the Sega CD didn't live up to its full potential. By 1994, the Genesis had lost the battle, in terms of sales. Nintendo had released key games for the SNES such as Donkey Kong Country, Super Metroid, and Star Fox, helping sales of their system, and elevating it past the sales of the Genesis with its Sega CD add-on. Not helping any, Sega Released another add-on for the genesis called the 32X that same year, trying to upgrade the power of their console cheaply, but consumers were not impressed, and the 32X only had a handful of games, many of which were just upgraded ports of older Genesis titles. Even if they lost the battle, the Mega Drive truly captured the hearts of many gamers everywhere, and was Sega's first large success.Also during 1990 and 1991 the Sega Game Gear was released to all countries. It had a total of 6 games for its launch and then soon spanning over multiple genres and over 300 games. Its game cartridges were not region coded, therefore any game could be played on any hand held anywhere in the world.Sega Game GearThe Game Gear was a portable Master System molded into hand held form. It had a lower resolution and a poor battery life. Compared to the Game Boy it was considered less efficient and its battery life (roughly 6 AA batteries) would last approximately 5 hours.It was also offered in a variant \"sport\" version, colored blue. Although the Game Gear was deemed superior to the Game Boy it was lackluster in sales and considered bulky. Sega stopped producing games for the system in 1997.After realizing that CD technology would be cheaper to produce, and allow the creation of higher-quality games, Sega planned a new console, called the Sega Saturn. Sega released the Sega Saturn in 1995, and at first, everybody was amazed by it.The Sega Saturn, US Region Release.It had some great titles such as Nights: Into Dreams, which was penned as being the new mascot for Sega. The Saturn was touted as a 32-bit 2D console, even though it did have some 3D games being developed for it, Sega was really pushing the 2D games. However, The Playstation won over the hearts of US gamers, and was penned as a 3D specific console, tailored specifically for 3D games. The N64 had a similar approach, in that it was tailored specifically for 3D gaming. Not only that, but it was released around the same time as the Playstation in the US. Both the Playstation and N64 did marvelously in the US, and Sega abandoned the Saturn in three years. However in Japan the Saturn did much better, outselling the Playstation into 1996, and defeating the N64. The Saturn was the most successful console Sega ever produced in Japan, but the same success was not shared in the U.S.The Sega Dreamcast, US Region Release.After the Saturn was discontinued, people were wondering what Sega would do next. They decided to produce a console called the Dreamcast. Released in the US on the mystifying date of 9/9/99, the console saw lots of commercial success within its first year because of the technical superiority to the N64 and Playstation. Its major focuses were on innovative and fun gameplay, it was also the first console to feature online play. The Dreamcast was also the first console to feature a modem port built directly into the back of their console. The games released for the system were innovative, fun, and graphically stunning, including one of the first cel-shaded games, Jet Grind Radio. Sega also released Sonic Adventure at the launch of the system, making Sonic Sega's mascot once again. Other titles such as Seaman, Samba de Amigo, and Shenmue were all innovative and fun, and received good press. It was definitely a big step up from the Saturn, but Sony was already planning a follow-up to the Playstation, called the PS2. The PS2 was released in October 2000, and received generally average press until 2001, when more great games began coming out. On top of that, Microsoft entered the market with the Xbox's release in 2001. Nintendo had another console in store for the market as well, the GameCube, which was released in November 2001. The Dreamcast at this point was, sadly, only an afterthought. What had Sega done wrong? They released their console too early, and all of the bad press from the Saturn carried over to the Dreamcast through the company's then-tarnished reputation. In 2002, Sega officially discontinued the Dreamcast; therewith announcing that they would only be developing software from that point forward.",

Stealey and Meier disagreed on more than one occassion, regarding issues extending the focus on console systems or easing up the focus on military games ( Sid Meier released Railroad Tycoon through Microprose).One strategy to broaden the publishing philosophy had been to create sub-divisionary brands to keep the association between MicroProse and military simulations intact, yet enabling the company to release games of other genres as well. The subdivisons were called MicroPlay and MicroStyle, the latter releasing titles such as Rick Dangerous and Elite Plus. It was not before Sid Meier's Civilization was released to a huge success, that Sid Meier's argument to release non-military games found solid ground. However, despite the success of titles such as Civilization and Pirates! and the X-Com series, MicroProse was in financial trouble. It was not long after MicroProse was acquired by Spectrum Holobyte in 1993 that Bill Stealey left the company and found Interactive Magic (releasing games such as Capitalism and Seven Kingdoms). Sid Meier left the company as well and founded Firaxis Games, taking some former employees of Microprose along for the venture.

    "description": "Activision was originally founded on October 1, 1979 and became the first independent developer and distributor of video games with its first games developed for the Atari 2600. Activision was founded by former music industry executive Jim Levy along with former Atari programmers David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead. Activision's first game release came in the form of Dragster in 1980, with their first big hit being Pitfall! in 1982. Pitfall! quickly became one of best selling Atari 2600 games ever selling over 4 million copies.On June 13, 1986, Activision merged with Infocom due to Jim Levy being a big fan of the company and did not want to see them fall. Six months later, Bruce Davis, who was heavily against the merger, became CEO of Activision. In 1989, the Infocom studios were finally closed by Activision putting 21 out of 26 employees out of business.In 1988, Activision moved on to produce more software outside of the video game industry and changed its corporate name to Mediagenic. Activision continued to develop video games, however, for many platforms including the NES, Sega Master System, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and Amiga.In the following years, Mediagenic had multiple financial issues including patent infringement suits and eventually was taken over by Robert Kotick, an investor group lead. The company eventually filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and merged with The Disc Company. Mediagenic started to rise out of bankruptcy, made some strategic acquisitions, and changed its name back to Activision in December 1992. Activision also moved its headquarters from Mountain View in the Silicon Valley to Santa Monica, CA deciding as well to produce only video games from that point on.In 1991, Activision released The Lost Treasures of Infocom which was a package of 20 Infocom games on one disc. A year later, Activision released another 11 games in The Lost Treasures of Infocom II.Partnership with Raven Software.Acquired CentreSoft, Ltd.Acquired NBG Distribution.Founded Pandemic Studios.Partnership with Marvel Entertainment.Partnership with Head Game Publishing.Partnership with Disney Interactive.Partnership with LucasArts Entertainment.Partnership with CD Contact Data.Acquired Neversoft.Acquired Expert Software.Acquired Gray Matter Interactive.Acquired Treyarch.Acquired Z-Axis, Ltd.Acquired Luxoflux Corporation.Partnership with DreamWorks SKG.Partnership with Valve.Partnership with Shaba Games, LLC.Partnership with Sega.Acquired Infinity Ward.Acquired Vicarious Visions.Acquired Toys For Bob.Acquired Beenox.Acquired RedOctane.Partnership with MGM Interactive.Acquired Bizarre Creations.Acquired Demonware.Giant merger with Vivendi to become Activision Blizzard.201010 Year Partnership with Bungie.Activision has been criticized for forcing developers to release games in popular franchises on a yearly basis. Examples include the Call Of Duty franchise, Guitar Hero franchise, and Tony Hawk franchise. Due to the limited time frame, developers often cannot alter the gameplay or other features significantly, thus releasing a game every year that is usually pretty similar to the one that came before it.In a recent interview with Game Informer, the studio head of Treyarch was asked what game he would like to develop next. He responded by saying that he isn't the one to make that decision, showing that even the heads of studios under Activision cannot escape the company's grasp.",

The company's success grew when they started releasing games for home consoles. They ported hit arcade games like Contra, Super C, Rush N Attack, Platoon, and Castlevaina to the NES and various PC formats. Konami also made console and PC exclusive games like Metal Gear.  Konami is also famous for creating the \" Konami Code\", first used in Gradius. However, it is most famous for its use in Contra, where inputting this code gave the player 30 lives. Sometimes, Konami uses the code in other games for a different effect.  Konami have worked on a number of IP-based games like TMNT, Tiny Toon Adventures, and Bucky O'Hare.Simon's Quest employed several features that would become mainstays in later games.Konami is credited for creating innovative games like Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest . Several features, like non-linear progression, buying weapons, and levelling up, would later be used in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for the Sony Playstation years later. From the success of SOTN, Konami created a series of handheld Castlevaina games with the same type of action/adventure gameplay. Other significant games include sports games like Double Dribble, shooters like Contra, and space shooters like Life Force and Gradius.Suikoden 2 has received much positive reception since its release.In 1995, Konami released Suikoden for the Sony Playstation, a console with many well-known RPG's. Suikoden was a turn-based RPG with strong Chinese and Japanese influences. Like SaGa games and other titles, the player could recruit up to 108 characters and use six during battle. The game was successful enough for Konami to release a sequel, Suikoden 2. It focused on the one thing many gamers felt the first lacked: a powerful story. Suikoden 2 featured a deep story about politics and war. With the success of Suikoden 2, Suikoden was established as an RPG franchise that would spawn several sequels and spin-offs.Silent Hill 2 is the sequel to Konami's PS1 venture into the survival horror genre.Another of Konami's major franchises is Silent Hill, released in 1999 as their response to other survival horrors of the time, like Resident Evil. Unlike Resident Evil, which focused on visceral scares, Silent Hill featured a tense atmosphere and deep plot elements. The game would become a success for the company and develop a solid fanbase. On the Playstation 2, Konami released a sequel, Silent Hill 2. The game was a critical and financial success, regarded by many as the best in the series. The series would go on to include various sequels and a film adaptation.Hideo Kojima is considered the Steven Spielberg of video games.In 1998, Konami developer Hideo Kojima created the stealth action game Metal Gear Solid. He was already known in the gaming world for games like Metal Gear, Snatcher, and Policenauts. However, he did not become particularly famous until his work on Metal Gear Solid on the PS1.  The game enjoyed both critical and financial success and, like several other Konami franchises, would be followed by many sequels, like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. The game was given more attention than its predecessor, from the movie-level production values to portions of the music having been written by Hollywood talent. It would become a big seller for the Playstation 2, but was criticized for its overly long cutscenes and confusing story. However, it was still successful enough to warrant a follow-up:  Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater . Konami also remade the original Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube, under the names Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. It employed many of the features Sons of Liberty did, like improved cinematics and aiming in a first person view. When the Playstation 3 came out, Konami released the final game in the Metal Gear storyline: Guns of the Patriots. Upon release, it earned notable amounts of praise.As of today, Konami is a very high profile video game company. They have a large dedicated fan base and create games for a wide range of platforms.",

    "description": "Acclaim Entertainment was founded in 1987 and went out of business in 2004. The company also published games under the labels LJN and Arena. While Acclaim did publish numerous games that were developed in-house, the company also had a long-standing relationship with Midway, which resulted in home versions of several Midway arcade games, including Mortal Kombat and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.Aside from software development and publishing, Acclaim also published some strategy guides. In 1994, Acclaim bought Valiant Comics (later renamed to Acclaim Comics). The company eventually adapted several of the former Valiant's intellectual properties into video game form, including Turok and Shadowman.Acclaim's fortunes dimmed in later years due to diminishing sales combined with a string of bad publicity. The company had a licensing agreement with Dave Mirra to create BMX titles, but when they attempted to tie Mirra's name to the horrendously juvenille BMX XXX, Mirra filed suit against Acclaim for misuse of his likeness. The Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, also sued Acclaim at one point, claiming that the company wasn't doing enough to support their license by releasing a series of substandard titles. Eventually, Acclaim's financial woes grew too severe to sustain operation and the company was forced to declare bankruptcy. All of Acclaim's assets, including its full library of releases and the name of the company itself were sold at auction to finance the company's liquidation. The Acclaim name was scooped up for a reported $100,000 by former Activision employee Howard Marks, who founded Acclaim Games as a publisher of smaller-scale free-to-play online games.Acclaim was notorious for promoting some of their games with peculiar publicity stunts. One example was an attempt to pay people to place advertisements for the game Shadowman on the tombstones of deceased relatives. Similarly, Acclaim also offered compensation for new parents that named their baby Turok in honor of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter.The following Studios were part of Acclaim Entertainment Inc.:Acclaim Studios Austin (former Iguana Entertainment )Acclaim Studios CheltenhamAcclaim Studios London (former Probe Entertainment)Acclaim Studios ManchesterAcclaim Studios Salt Lake City (former Sculptured Software)Acclaim Studios Teesside",

    "description": "On September 23 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo Koppai, a small Japanese business based in Kyoto, Japan, which produced and marketed a playing card game called Hanafuda. The name Nintendo translates to \"leave luck to heaven.\" Originally, Yamauchi produced all of the cards himself, painting them by hand- but as the business grew in popularity, he had to hire assistants to keep up with demand.In 1956, Fusajiro Yamauchi's grandson Hiroshi Yamauchi went to visit and began talks with the leading playing card manufacturer in the the US, The United States Playing Card Company. Realizing the limitations of the playing card business, Hiroshi Yamauchi acquired the licenses to Disney's characters and put them on Nintendo's playing cards to help drive sales. The company was renamed in 1963 from Nintendo Playing Card Company Limited to Nintendo Company, and began experimenting in other ventures and other areas of business. In just 5 years from 1963 to 1968, Nintendo expanded to include a taxi company, a \"Love Hotel\" chain, a TV station and a food company which sold instant rice - similar to the popular instant noodles in Japan. However the new business ventures did not last and were eventually closed, and Nintendo was left with 60 Yen in stock with a dwindling playing card market.Undeterred by its failed business ventures, Nintendo refocused its business strategy to the Japanese toy industry. Nintendo's first toy was the Ultra Hand, an extending arm that was developed by Gunpei Yokoi in his free time. Yokoi was promoted from the company's maintenance engineer to product developer in Nintendo's newly formed Nintendo Games department. Nintendo continued to produce popular toys, including the Ultra Machine, Love Tester, and the Kousenjuu series of light gun games; the Kousenjuu, produced in partnership with Sharp, were the first light guns available for home use. Despite some successful products, Nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required of the toy market, and fell behind the well-established companies such as Bandai and Tomy.Nintendo's business strategy again re shifted in 1973 to family entertainment with the Laser Clay Shooting System, using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo's Kousenjuu series of toys, and set up in abandoned bowling alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines for the emerging arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs, Nintendo had found a new untapped market.Nintendo's roots in the video game industry began as early as 1971. That was the year when they began working with Magnavox on the Shooting Gallery light gun, building on their experience with the Kousenjuu light guns. According to video game historian Martin Picard: \"in 1971, Nintendo had -- even before the marketing of the first home console in the United States -- an alliance with the American pioneer Magnavox to develop and produce optoelectronic guns for the Odyssey (released in 1972), since it was similar to what Nintendo was able to offer in the Japanese toy market in 1970s\".In 1974, Nintendo went on to create the light-gun shooter electro-mechanical arcade game Wild Gunman, and they they were given the rights to distribute the Magnavox Odyssey home video game system in Japan. It wasn't until 1977 that Nintendo began to make its own video game console - four systems to be exact, each playing variations on a single game; for example, Color TV Game 6 featured six versions of Light Tennis. The Color TV Game was Nintendo's first success with video games in Japan. During this time, Nintendo hired student product developer Shigeru Miyamoto, who worked under Gunpei Yokoi. One of Miyamoto's projects at Nintendo was to design the casing for several of the Color TV Game systems and went on to create some of Nintendo's most famous video games. He has since become one of the most recognizable faces in the video game industry today.Nintendo moved into the arcade video game industry in 1978, which produced little success at first. They began gaining some modest success in the arcades with Sheriff and Radar Scope, though the latter became a flop in North America despite its modest success in Japan. It was not until Nintendo launched the Game & Watch (a hand-held video game series developed by Yokoi) in 1980 and especially the 1981 arcade release of Donkey Kong, designed by Miyamoto, that Nintendo began to see worldwide success and a huge boost in profits.The Family Computer, or the Famicom as it was more commonly called, was launched in 1983 in Japan with ports of its most popular arcade titles. The system launched in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, and was accompanied by Super Mario Bros., which became the best-selling video game of all time, and remained so for the next three decades (up until the 2006 release of Wii Sports). The NES was credited with reviving the declining North American video game industry. The Nintendo Entertainment System was superseded by the Super Famicom, known outside Japan as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which introduced shoulder buttons and pseudo-3D tilemap scaling to console gaming. The Nintendo 64, most notable for its 3D graphics capabilities, introduced the analog stick and multi-player for up to four players instead of two. The Nintendo GameCube followed, and was the first Nintendo system to use optical disc storage instead of cartridges, and popularized the use of wireless contollers. The Wii then introduced accelerometer-based motion sensing controllers and had a more developed online functionality, used for services such as Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, Virtual Console and Wii Ware. The latest Nintendo console is the Wii U, which uses a touch-screen controller.Nintendo's hand-held video game market grew in parallel with its home console counterpart. After the Game & Watch, hand-held development continued with the Game Boy, followed soon after by the Super Game Boy and Game Boy Color, each differing in minor aspects. The Game Boy continued for more than a decade until the release of the Game Boy Advance, featuring technical specifications similar to the SNES. The Game Boy Advance SP, a front lit, flip-screen version with a lighted screen, introduced a rechargeable built-in battery that replaced the AA batteries of its predecessors. The next Nintendo hand-held console was the Nintendo DS which utilizes two screens, the bottom of which is a touchscreen. It also offers online functionality, and possesses technical power similar to that of the Nintendo 64. Nintendo soon released the DS Lite, a smaller and lighter version of the hand-held. The next redesign of the DS was the DSi which increased the size of the the screens, offered a DSi shop, and allowed users to take pictures with a built-in camera. The DSi XL offered even larger screens. Nintendo's most recent hand-held, the Nintendo 3DS, allows stereoscopic 3D effects without the use of glasses, i.e. autostereoscopic 3D.Today, Nintendo Company Ltd. is the longest-surviving video game console manufacturer to date, outlasting Atari and Sega. Nintendo is still considered one of \"The Big 3\" in the gaming industry, alongside Microsoft and Sony. Before that, their main competitor was Sega, prior to its exit from the console manufacturing sector of the video game industry.The new Nintendo logo (in use since 2006)In 2006 Nintendo began using a gray logo, instead of it's traditional red logo.In 2008 Nintendo issued a press release asking media publications to stop using the traditional red logo, and to use the up to date gray logo.",

Other games regionalized (yet not altered) included the Phantasy Star series, Riven and Shining in the Darkness. Due to this regional marketing effort, SEGA was and still is a very popular gaming platform. As of today, the company is still active, yet broadened the product array to include other electronic hardware such as MP3 Players, Audio Systems or Karaoke Machines. Due to regional economic conditions, the production of old Master Systems and Mega Drive is still going on via Tec Toy, although the technology is updated and the console systems now include a built-in selection of games.Tec Toy is also one of the companies behind the Zeebo.",

First game made by the new studio was a point and click adventure entitled 'Tajemnica Statuetki' (roughly translates to 'Secret of the Statuette'). It used pictures made by Chmielarz in his trip to Saint-Tropez. To make the photographs useful, he had to edit them to remove his friend, whit whom he went to France. 5 thousand copies of the game was sold, which was a big success in post-communism reality in Poland.Next game developed by Metropolis was followed by unprecedented marketing campaign. Teenagent, released in 1995, is believed to be one of the best polish adventure games. It's also one of the first games coming from this country to be released on CD. Teenagent was translated to four languages, including English. It was never sold outside the country, but distributed as shareware.Metropolis made big plans for upcoming years but next game was released two years later. Katharsis was a scrolling shooter, in which player controlled a ship called Eagle to fight an alien invasion.Ksiaze i Thorz (Prince and the Thief) was another point and click adventure game. Jacek Piekara, well known polish author contributed to the story. Other game released in 1998 was Reflux - real-time strategy set in futuristic setting.Moods begin to shift in Metropolis, when Chmielarz left company in 2002 after disagreement with co-founders. Company developed few more games in following years, including mediocre sequels to Gorky 17. Last successful games made by Metropolis was Infernal, telling a story about forces from hell and heaven battling each other. Player controlled Ryan Lennox, who joins with the bad guys to regain his abilities.Huge plans were made once again to develop They, futuristic first person shooter with modifiable weapons. In 2009 Metropolis was acquired by CD Projekt. They was subsequently cancelled and all forced focused on Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Some employees left the company to fund 11 but studios.

Visceral also keeps a branch office in Montreal, Canada; a former branch in Melbourne, Australia, was closed in September, 2011.Dead Space is the most recent and name-making game franchise produced by Visceral games. Dead Space was pitched by the lead designer of Visceral Games to EA executives after getting tired of working on teen- or lower-rated titles. EA granted a small development team within Visceral Games a six month period in which to flesh out their design to demonstrate its potential as a full-scale production. Rather than going the traditional route of producing an in-depth design document for their game; Visceral created a vertical slice prototype of their game, which they decided to call Dead Space. The motivation behind this approach was that the team felt that tangible hands-on experience with a piece of their game would sell the game far better than would trying to merely describe it.The first Dead Space was released in 2008 and met with very positive reception both critically and commercially. As of August 3, 2010, EA reported that the game had sold upwards of 2 million copies. The game was acclaimed as a successful blend of survival horror and third-person shooting, a pairing spearheaded by Resident Evil 4, with modernizations for the current console generation. The game also introduced 'strategic dismemberment' as a central gameplay mechanic. Dead Space 2 launched in 2011 and has received a similarly positive reception. Critics have praised the game as a successful, archetypical sequel: more of what was good in the last game, less of what wasn't.Visceral Games has been rumored to currently be working on a downloadable title for PSN and XBLA called The Ripper.",

    "description": "In 1991, Epic was just one man, Tim Sweeney, working out of his parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Under the name Potomac Computer Systems, Sweeney developed and released a simple DOS game, ZZT, one of the first ever games that could be easily modified with a scripting language. Distributed through BBSes and and mail order, ZZT spread like wildfire as users latched on to the ability to create new levels and new game types with the editor tools. Using the steady income stream from ZZT's popularity, Sweeney decided to step things up a notch and came up with the name Epic MegaGames to compete with major players in the shareware industry - or in his words, \"I realized that we needed a serious name, so I came up with 'Epic MegaGames' -- kind of a scam to make it look like we were a big company.\"Under this new name, and the success of ZZT under his belt, Sweeney quickly was able to parlay his abilities into a production and management role, collaborating with other developers to release titles that quickly took the early/mid 90's DOS game world by storm. Epic MegaGames was the name behind classics like Jill of the Jungle (a Sweeney solo effort), Jazz Jackrabbit (with Cliff Bleszinski and Arjan Brussee), Epic Pinball (with James Schmalz) and Ken's Labyrinth (one of the first FPS's, with Ken Silverman.)Around late 1994, the Epic team decided to channel all of their resources, financial and otherwise, into a wildly ambitious project: Unreal. At the time, the cutting edge of 3D gaming was Doom II, and Unreal was, from the beginning, designed to be an engine with three full dimensions of freedom, dynamically located sound, dynamic lighting, and other features now taken for granted. On top of this, Sweeney and the Epic team added a real-time, in-engine editing system, UnrealEd. After years of development, the game was released in May, 1998 to wide critical acclaim. The Unreal Engine was considered a stellar technical achievement, at least as good as its primary competitor, id Software's Quake II engine, and was rolled into a package to be licensed to other development companies. Dozens of major hit games have incorporated Unreal technology since 1998.After years of concentrating on engine development, in 2006 Epic Games released Gears of War, an Xbox 360 shooter which quickly leapt to the top of the charts, amassing nearly six million units sold. The 2008 sequel Gears of War 2 recently topped five million. Both received wide critical acclaim, primarily being praised for technical excellence and execution of classic concepts. Similarly lauded was 2009's Shadow Complex, one of the top-ten Xbox Live Arcade games of all time.In 2007, Canadian developer Silicon Knights filed suit (case number 5-07-CV-00275-D) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, charging as follows: \"Rather than provide support to Silicon Knights and Epic’s other many licensees of the Engine, Epic intentionally and wrongfully has used the fees from those licenses to launch its own game to widespread commercial success while simultaneously sabotaging efforts by Silicon Knights and others to develop their own video games.\" In 2012, just weeks before E3, Epic Games won the lawsuit, being awarded $4.45 Million in counterclaim damages, \"namely that Silicon Knights breached the license agreement, misappropriated Epic's trade secrets, and infringed Epic's copyrights in the Unreal Engine 3 code.\"Mere days following the lawsuit's culmination, on June 3rd, 2012 Epic announced they had met with team leadership from the recently dissolved 38 Studios subsidiary Big Huge Games, and will be establishing a new development studio in the Baltimore area to work on Epic's intellectual properties. Mike Capps was soon quoted by Joystiq that Epic has no intention of purchasing the Amalur IP from the state of Rhode Island: \"We don't buy IP, we make IP.\"Tim Sweeney – FounderMichael V.

Originally, the company was focused on hardware, namely interchangable tapes and parts inside arcade cabinets. Data East actually developed the first cartridge-based arcade system, the DECO Casette System, which was released in 1980.It wasn't until 1979 that Data East began developing and publishing software. During the 1980's, Data East released some of the biggest arcade hits of the era including Burgertime, Bad Dudes Vs. Dragon Ninja, RoboCop, and Karate Champ. PC and console ports of many of these games were also commissioned and were rather successful. Data East also purchased licenses from companies such as Capcom, SNK, and Irem in order to manufacture and create arcade games based on their unique properties. It was this string of popular arcade and console hits that allowed Data East to weather the video game crash of 1983 better than most other companies.Data East is also well known as a developer and manufacturer of pinball tables. In 1985, the company purchased the pinball division of Stern Electronics including all of its factories and assets. During their time in the pinball market, Data East advanced pinball technology with many innovations such as stereo sound and dot matrix displays which are still commonly found in pinball games today. Data East primarily developed pinball tables that featured high-profile licensed properties such as Guns N' Roses, Star Wars, RoboCop, The Simpsons, Batman, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.During the early 1990's, Data East began to struggle financially. Data East spent a lot of money in acquiring expensive high-profile licenses for their pinball tables, and thus, when the market for pinball games began to shrink and sales plummeted, Data East was hit very hard. In 1994, Data East USA was sold to Sega as a part of debt settlement and later on in 1996 the entire pinball division of Data East was sold to Sega. In 1999, Sega sold all pinball assets that formerly belonged to Data East to Gary Stern who used it to create the Stern Pinball company. From 1999 to 2003, Data East sold electronics components and licensed out some of their game properties in the hopes of recovering from their financial woes and gaining enough capital to begin making games again. However, these efforts were not enough to save the company, and on June 25, 2003, Data East Corporation was declared bankrupt by a Tokyo district court. Paon Corporation, Ltd. bought the rights to some of Data East's games, and have since released some of them on the Wii virtual console. However, the vast majority of the Data East properties were acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, a Japanese mobile games publisher. G-Mode has gone on to release mobile versions of several of Data East's arcade classics, but they are currently attempting to sell many of the licenses. G-Mode currently has deals in place to release Data East titles on the Wii virtual console and Gametap among other places.",

After experiencing several years of rapid growth (at once point approaching the size of rival Electronic Arts), Titus made a number of what at the time were high profile acquisitions including BlueSky Software, Digital Integration, Virgin Interactive Entertainment (renamed to Avalon Interactive in 2003) and a majority stake in the also publicly traded Interplay Entertainment Corp. which was experiencing financial difficulties.  After acquiring their stake in Interplay, Hervé Caen was named its CEO after co-founder and long time CEO Brian Fargo announced his resignation.In the years following, Titus releases began a rapid and continuous decline in quality (the low points of which are the infamously awful Superman 64 and Robocop for the original Xbox), with few receiving even mediocre review scores and experiencing very poor sales as a result.  They were also unable to turn around Interplay's fortunes, experiencing poor sales on their titles as well, even the few that reviewed well.  Titus continued to pour their resources into Interplay, hoping that they would ultimately lead a return to success for both companies.  This never happened and resulted in the sudden collapse of both companies (including all their subsidiaries) in 2004, leading to a number of highly publicized legal battles with employees, investors, developers, landlords and tax agencies, many of which are still ongoing.  Eventually, the French government forced Titus Interactive into liquidation but named Hervé Caen as the person in charge of administring said liquidation, after which he reportedly promptly transferred what few assets Titus had left to Interplay, leaving investors with absolutely nothing. Interplay does continue to exist as a publicly traded company with Hervé Caen as CEO and is reportedly working on new internally developed projects.",

    "description": "Nolan BushnellThe story of Atari ultimately is the story of the birth of the video game industry as a whole. Ted Dabney and Nolan Bushnell's release of Pong changed the way people interact with games; taking it further than the board games that so many were accustomed to, into both the home living room and to the personal computers that were finally becoming small and affordable enough to become reasonable purchases for entertainment. A golden age for Atari occurred from 1977 to 1981, with the release of their most enduring legacy - the Atari 2600. This single platform introduced many of the classic games that continually come up in any conversation of highly revered classics for many people's childhood (and/or young adulthood) memories. In the end, the first incarnation of Atari (right up to the purchase by Jack Tramiel in 1984) represents a historic time in history for the video game industry. Many of the cornerstones were built right here with this company, and the story is just as interesting simply because it rekindles memories within so many of the people that have come to be major forces in leading the gaming industry to where it is today.An Original Atari Pong CabinetAtari's naming was of special significance to Nolan Bushnell, as it was named after his favorite game - Japan's centuries old classic Go. The term \"atari\" is used by Go players to politely inform their opponent that they are about to be overrun. The company was created in 1972 with money earned by Bushnell's first game Computer Space. While this initial game was not considered to be a success financially, it seeded the ideas for the game Pong, which would become the first gaming classic the budding gaming industry would see. By most gaming historians, this is considered to be the true birth of the gaming industry as it sparked countless knock-offs, and eventually brought video games into the home. Until now, video games were not considered mass market items, and had not penetrated into people's lives like this would.Far simpler than most games of the time, the idea of Pong was an electronic version of ping pong. It may be said that it is the simplicity that sparked the imagination of the masses in America, bringing video games to the mass market for the first time. It was no longer only relegated to the likes of computer engineers and college researchers. First marketed as a coin-operated machine placed in restaurants and bars, the game captured the hearts and minds of America. Headlines and nightly news shows sang the praises of this new form of entertainment that was quickly spreading across the nation like wildfire. Atari's Pong created a market for clones, and unfortunately its own version was quickly marginalized in the same market that it helped create. Many of the knock-offs managed to corner a vast majority of the market. Within two years of the games introduction in late 1972, only 10% of the cabinets produced were sold.What profits were made were quickly invested in many projects and ventures that, in hindsight, come across as shortsighted and nonproductive. The financial burden of half a million dollars used to try and penetrate the Japanese market with their products proved to be one of the largest blows to both the founders when it eventually failed and was aborted. None of the successive arcade games that they produced managed to incite the imaginations and hearts of Americans like Pong did, forcing Atari to think of a much different strategy in their own fight to stay solvent and survive within this burgeoning market. Taking a cue from Magnavox's Odyssey, which was the first home console created, Atari entered into a partnership with Sears, Roebuck & Company to create their own platform. Sears, becoming the sole retailer, agreed to purchase all 100,000 units built, signaling the introduction of Pong for the home in the fall of 1975. It proved to be quite a success as Sears saw a huge demand for this game during 1975's holiday season. While the Odyssey is considered to be the first hole console, it was Atari's PONG (and the many successive iterations) that would capture the majority of people's mind share.Atari VCS (aka Atari 2600)While the success of PONG managed to help Atari gain a lifeline, it was not a panacea for their problems. What was brewing underneath was much more complicated, and the financial problems were only the beginning of what would eventually lead to the sale of Atari to Warner Communications in 1976 for $28 - $32 Million (est .). The reality was that their PONG machines could only be used for one game, and the same people that lined up in droves in late 1975 quickly become disinterested with this single-minded novelty. The release of the MOS Technology 6502 in 1976, gave Atari the ability to put a CPU in what would become their VCS ( Atari 2600) that was both cost effective and powerful enough to make it the multi-game console that they were looking to release.In 1977 Atari was able to release what would become their lasting legacy, the Atari 2600. This machine allowed players to play several games on one console. During the first holiday season in 1977, the 2600 did not manage to supplant the PONG machines, and was met with stiff competition from several other manufacturers that had built multi-game machines as well. The reality was that for as much as the 2600 would eventually signal in a golden age for Atari, this initial response was a huge burden on the company financially.Atari 400The majority of 1978 did not bring much change to the companies outlook, as more strife was brewing between the employees and leadership of Atari and the heads of Warner Communications. All of the internal chaos culminated in a budget meeting in New York where Bushnell was ousted from his position as chair of the company. In his place, several executives were hired that had a stronger business background within larger corporations. The ensuing months represented a large change in focus, as a $6 million ad campaign was put into place at the tail-end of 1978 aiming to clear out the backlogged inventory that most retailers had, making way for new games that would be coming out shortly thereafter. This brought about a huge turnaround in their financial viability as they were able to create a buzz around the 2600 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 1979, with store owners demanding more products to sell.Over the course of the next year (1979) they were able to sell all of their stock of machines that were manufactured to retailers. Atari would enjoy an ever increasing lion's share of the home console market through 1981, with $740 million worth of cartridges and consoles being sold over this time period. Great financial success came from the large profit margins built into the release of each game cartridge, which at its peak, were being produced at a rate of one each month. The only competition came from Mattel's Intellivision in 1980, but the 2600 managed to overcome its strong ad campaign, remaining the console of choice for the vast majority of households (80% market share by the end of 1981)Atari 800Another arm of Atari was forming concurrently to the team that headed up the research and development of the 2600. This part of the company was focused on the burgeoning home computer market, and they tried to produce the most powerful machine on the market. Both the Atari 800 and 400, being aimed at this new market, were met with strong competition from the Apple II. This division initially lost an estimated $10 million, but was more than offset with the strong profits that the 2600 was able to produce for Atari as a whole. By the end of 1981 the home computing division managed to become profitable, dominating the sales of low-priced home computers.Atari 5200Even with the great successes that Atari manged to produce through the end of 1981, a larger concern was starting to brew. With their emphasis on new software products being the companies main focus, they did not put enough attention into a true successor to the 2600 early enough. The only hardware products that had been introduced were expensive add-ons that did not manage to gain any traction at retail (i.e. a remote control model known as Touch Me). A large amount of their financial resources were quickly put into research and development of the 2600's true successor - what would ultimately become the Atari 5200. Many analysts truly felt that Atari would remain at the front of the home console market, possibly indefinitely, but stiff competition from other hardware and software companies proved to be the beginning of their eventual fall from grace. Upwards of 30 other game makers launched onto the scene, all vying for a piece of the ever-growing market share; one of these companies being Nintendo, which would eventually take the world by storm with the release of the Famicom (released in Japan in 1983) and NES (released in the rest of the world in 1985).In a financial call during December 1982, Warner Communications would announce that their previous sales estimates would have to be reduced because they could not be met due to \"unexpected cancellations and disappointing sales during the first week of December.\" The harsh reality was that many of Atari's lead game designers were leaving to go to other companies, delivering a blow to the company that they would not be able to recover from. The eventual fallout from this financial call would soon become debilitating as the stock's price would plummet dramatically and several Atari executives would be investigated by the SEC for insider trading. While all charges would eventually be dropped, the repercussions were already set into motion, causing 1,700 US workers to be laid off and all US manufacturing facilities to be moved to Hong Kong and Taiwan.Redesigned logo for Atari CorporationsThe prognosis was not any better in Atari's home computing division, as it was also being met with stiff competition from other computing manufacturers. Even with significant cuts to the price of the 400, total losses for the company in the first quarter of 1983 reached $46 million. Nolan Bushnell was approached by Atari to try and reinvigorate the former innovative luster that it had, but even this was not enough to stimey the eventual losses that they would incur. The one bright light came with Nintendo, as they approached Atari to enter into a partnership to produce the hardware for the NES/Famicon. The June 1983 CES was to be the forum in which they would both sign and announce their deal, but the entire agreement dissolved after Coleco demoed Nintendo's Donkey Kong on their new Adam computer . Nintendo would eventually decide to make their own hardware, and the downward spiral of Atari's finances came to a head shortly after, culminating in a mass layoff of 10,000 employees - nearly half of the company.In July of 1984, a $240 million deal was struck between Atari and ex-head of Commodore, Jack Tramiel, and all of Atari was sold except for the small coin-operated arcade business, Ataritel. Immediately following the sale, Tramiel began aggressive cost cutting measures, laying off hundreds more employees and making strong efforts to collect on all unpaid debts and balances. Because so many unwanted game cartridges were unable to be sold, Atari dumped truckloads of them into a New Mexico landfill. Atari would eventually be renamed Atari Corporation and would never be able to regain control of the console market, or have the same amount of clout that they had during the peak of the 2600's popularity.",

    "description": "Founded in 1958, Midway Games only transitioned into video games in 1973, after manufacturing amusement equipment such as mechanical arcade games. Midway has developed and published some of the most successful arcade and home console games ever made, including the Mortal Kombat series, Ms. Pac-Man and Space Invaders. However, the company began to experience net losses and eventually filed for bankruptcy in February 2009. In July 2009 Midway’s assets were purchased by Warner Brothers, who retained the Mortal Kombat studio in which would become NetherRealm Studios in June 2010.Midway Manufacturing was one of the earliest American video game developers, though it initially kept to the arcade market. This, and its early success, was facilitated by a strong link with Taito that lasted throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, leading to the distribution rights for Taito games. Midway began branching into the home market with its one and only attempt at developing a home system in the form of the Bally Astrocade, named after the company that purchased Midway in 1969.The real breakthrough success that had somewhat alluded Midway finally came in the form of the distribution of Space Invaders, followed closely by Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. Midway became the foremost arcade developer in the US, putting out titles such as Defender, NBA Jam and Spy Hunter. After years of developing under first the Bally name and, later on, the Williams name, Midway adsorbed the Williams video game division and started working under their own name again.In 1992, Midway put out a quickly developed arcade fighter, intended to serve as a competitor to Street Fighter II. Mortal Kombat would go on to define the company, and become one of the most popular arcade and home console games created. Mortal Kombat was a breakthrough in Midway’s home console strategy, and the success of the sequels established it as a premier Midway franchise.The End of an EraIn 1996, for the first time since 1968, Midway became an independent company again. Over this period, Midway began cutting ties with its previous form, and terminated its part in the pinball industry. Midway also cut its arcade manufacture, citing financial losses year over year. Over the next eight years Midway began buying up a number of existing third party developers, hoping to expand and solidify its development abilities. It was here that Midway began experiencing the financial problems that would lead them to bankruptcy. Between 2004 and 2007, Midway began experiencing net losses each year but continued on until February 12, 2009, when it filed for bankruptcy.Midway’s assets were purchased on July 1, 2009 by Warner Bros. The remaining development teams were later brought together as NetherRealm Studios, a subsidiary of WB Games.",

    "description": "Maxis was created by Will Wright and Jeff Braun in order to publish SimCity on PCs, as the game was at the time only available for the Commodore 64, due to the tiny number of publishers willing to port it. The game was a giant success which made Maxis develop many more sequels and expansions as well as some non-Sim games (such as RoboSport and 3D Pinball for Windows).Following the success of SimCity, Maxis experimented with different genres and ultimately-failed. Financial troubles were also caused by the acquisition of Cinematronics, LLC to publish the debacle Crucible. This ultimately forced Maxis to accept take-over offers. EA bought Maxis in 1997 and with them published the most successful PC franchise of all time, The Sims. They also made two SimCity sequels and the more recent Spore.Maxis is well known for their innovative games which most of the time don't have an end goal or a win-lose condition, making the game almost endless.SimCity was the first game developed by Maxis. In this game the player is a mayor tasked with running the city and turning it from a small village to a successful metropolis by taking care of the economy and public services. The franchise includes 5 main games (SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 and SimCity Societies, although it should be noted that SimCity Societies wasn't made by Maxis but by Tilted Mill Entertainment). The series also includes 3 spin-offs (SimCity: The Card Game, SimCopter and Streets of SimCity).Maxis' best selling game and the best selling PC game of all time. The Sims is a game in which players are given the task of managing the needs, careers, friendships and other aspects of the lives of virtual people called \"sims\". The series is comprised of three main games (The Sims, The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, although it should be noted Will Wright did not work on the entirety of the series), an online version (The Sims Online) as well as 7 expansion packs for each game, and a number of spin-offs.Spore is the most recent franchise from Maxis. In it players create a species that is to evolve from a single-cell organism to a creature that rules the universe. Spore consists of a single main game (Spore), many part packs which let players customise their creatures in new ways, as well as an expansion pack (Spore: Galactic Adventures)",

    "description": "The Creative Assembly is a Sussex, UK-based game development studio that was founded by Tim Ansell in 1987. Though The Creative Assembly has worked in other genres, the company has become predominantly known for its Total War series of strategy games.The Creative Assembly started to make sports title for Electronic Arts back in 1993 under the EA sports banner. Franchises developed included Rugby World Cup, 1999 Cricket World Cup and Austrailain Football Leauge. In 1999, Creative Assembly had the budget and resources to develop a brand new strategy game called Shogun: Total War. Originally designed to be a knock off of the Command and Conquer games, it ended up using its own formula of gameplay, using turn based strategy in the campaign map and real time strategy for the battles. When released on June 13, 2000, the game got much praise and won numerous strategy game of the year awards in 2000. In 2001, Creative Assembly announced it would release Shogun: Total War - Mongol Invasion as an expansion pack. This would be the last Creative Assembly release under the EA banner as the Creative Assembly broke from EA and got Activision as its new publisher.In 2001, the Creative Assembly announced a new Total War game under development, this time set in medieval Europe. This was Medieval: Total War, which was even bigger and more technically advanced than Shogun. When released in August 2002, it sold better than Shogun, garnished much praise and won many awards, including the top game of 2002 award from PC Gamer.The third total war game to be developed was Rome: Total War, which was announced by the Creative Assembly in early 2003. The engine was much different to how previous installments were made, as for the first time in the franchise's history, troops in the battles were in 3D. This new engine was so innovative, that television shows like History Channel's Decisive Battles and BBC's TIme Commanders used this new engine to add realistic graphics as to how ancient armies fought from the Roman Era. After its release in September 2004, the game became the most well-received iteration of the Total War franchise, one of the top ten best selling PC games of 2004 and won nearly every strategy game of the year award from the press.After Rome's great success in 2004, many thought the Creative Assembly would stay with Activision. However on March 9 2005, it was announced that Sega had bought all shares in the company and acquired the British-based developer. Sega wanted to make its presence in European and North American markets greater and saw the Creative Assembly as an opportunity to help sell in the Western video game markets. In 2005, Sega had published two games developed by the Creative Assembly, Rome: Total War, Barbarian Invasion, which was the expansion pack to Rome: Total War, and Spartan: Total Warrior. Spartan was an action game that played much like God of War, which was released earlier in 2005. Despite being seen by some as a God of War clone, the game still got mostly favorable reception from the press.The first non-expansion Total War title published by Sega would be Medieval 2: Total War. The game was a sequel to Medieval: Total War, but used the same technology of Rome Total War. While it was not as successful as Rome, Medieval 2, like its previous installments, got critical acclaim and sold well.After Spartan: Total Warrior, the Creative Assembly had developed more multi-platform console games to see if they could have a console franchise that would be as successful as the Total War franchise. The next console game was Viking: Battle For Asgard, which was another action game that was set in Norse mythology. The game got mixed reviews, for some praised it for having brutal battles, it was also panned for having inconsistent sound design and a lackluster plot. In June 2008, the Creative Assembly announced a multi-platform strategy game called Stormrise. This game would be developed by the Creative Assembly's Australian branch, who was also behind developing Medieval 2: Total War. However, the game soon became the Creative Assembly's worst received title to date getting criticisms like having a terrible control design and flawed pathfinding. Right now the Creative Assembly is working on a tentative Alien title for the consoles, but nobody knows when it will be released.As for the Total War franchise, the Total War series is still the flagship franchise of the Creative Assembly. In 2009, Empire: Total War was released, being set in colonial times going from the 18th century to the early 19th century. Empire also got a brand new engine to fit the combat that took place in the game's setting. The game outsold both Medieval 2: Total War and Rome: Total War and was highly praised by the media upon release. However, the game was often criticized by fans and customers for having many glitches, hinting that perhaps the game wasn't complete when released to the public. In 2010, Napoleon: Total War was released which had a similar gameplay technique and had addressed most of the problems that Empire had. Also like Empire, it got great praise from the media, but some questioned if a game playing much like Empire should of been sold as a retail game or just as an expansion pack. In 2011, the most recent Total War installment, Total War: Shogun 2, was released, serving as the sequel to the first Total War title, Shogun: Total War. The game has gotten universal praise and has won many strategy game of the year awards for 2011. Most recently The Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Rome II.GamesShogun: Total WarShogun: Total War - Mongol InvasionMedieval: Total WarMedieval: Total War - Viking InvasionRome: Total WarRome: Total War, Barbarian InvasionRome: Total War - AlexanderMedieval 2: Total WarMedieval 2: Total War - KingdomsEmpire: Total WarNapoleon: Total WarTotal War: Shogun 2Total War: Rome IIRugbyRugby 2001Spartan: Total WarriorViking: Battle For AsgardStormriseAlien: Isolation",

The 3DO Company is responsible for the 3DO and the Heroes of Might and Magic franchise. The company disappeared in 2003 after filing for bankruptcy.Trip HawkinsThe 3DO Company was created with one objective in mind: to make a console. And not just any console. A console where games would be played on a CD (this was a revolutionary idea at the time since most games still came on cartridges) and developing games for the console would be cheap (royalties were only $3 per game). The 3DO company lived on these royalties and saved money by outsourcing the construction of their console. This was also a revolutionary way of doing business at the time, building their console like an airplane. They'd get parts from different companies shipped to their factories where the console would be assembled. Production costs were low meaning that the royalties could be low. This business structure was designed to compete with Sega and Nintendo who were charging developers more in royalties to make games on their consoles.The 3DO launched in 1993 at 699$. Despite a massive marketing push and third party support, the console was a failure. It was in part due to the price but also in part due to the fact that wind had already broken that Nintendo was developing a new console that would be more powerful than the 3DO. As the 3DO Company's stock dropped and despite the 1996 price cut, the 3DO Multiplayer System was discontinued at the end of 1996.This led to some major changes at 3DO. First of all, they were forced to abandon the successor of the 3DO, the M2. Second of all, the whole company was restructured in order to specialize in game developing.In order to develop quality games, 3DO acquired Archetype Interactive, Cyclone Studios and New World Computing. The 3DO company developed many games over their 12 years of existence, most notably Army Men and Heroes of Might and Magic.Despite developing games for all systems, the 3DO company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2003 and had to sell most of their licenses to competitors.",

    "description": "The company that would eventually become Krome Studios started life as several Australian splinter companies, founded years apart.Melbourne House was founded in the UK in 1978 as Melbourne House--for the purpose of publishing books--by Australian ex-pats Alfred Milgrom and Naomi Besen. Seeing the success of the burgeoning video game industry in the US and Japan, they retooled that business plan in 1980 to involve localization and importation of US games for the UK market. Fortuitously, soon after the announcement of this change, the Sinclair ZX80 was released. Milgrom jumped on this opportunity by writing a book for the home computer market and distributing it through his own company. The book was a success, and it convinced the two founders that they could make money by focusing entirely on the video game market.The founders returned to Melbourne and founded Beam Software in late 1980 to localize and import US games to a largely-untapped Australian market (essentially the same business plan as Melbourne House, minus the book publishing). 1981 was largely spent publishing software for the VIC-20 and Sinclair ZX81, but in 1982 Beam released its first in-house production The Hobbit for the newly-released ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum would go on to become one of the most popular video game platforms in UK/Australian history, and The Hobbit would eventually go on to become one of the best-sellers for the Spectrum. This early success cemented the company's market position, and allowed the company to hire more programmers for in-house games.By 1987, the company was entirely focused on Beam's work importing and creating video games for the English-speaking market, and it jettisoned the Melbourne House name to Mastertronic. Beam also made history in this year by becoming the second non-Japanese company to receive a developer license for the NES, in exchange for promising Nintendo that it would discontinue the sales of its (extremely unauthorized) NES development system.In 1988, the mega-media conglomerate Virgin Group purchased Mastertronic, obtaining Melbourne House in the deal. However, Virgin already had a strong name-brand in its Virgin Games label, and they shuttered Melbourne House entirely.1996 saw Beam Software make two major corporate changes, by both becoming the first publicly-listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange under the name Beam International Ltd., and re-registering the trade name \"Melbourne House,\" which Virgin had allowed to lapse.Just three years later, in 1999, Beam International sold all of its game development and publishing operations--which now consisted of over 130 employees in a number of offices--to Infogrames. The studio was renamed Infogrames Melbourne House. At the same time, Krome Studios was founded by Steve Stamatiadis and Robert Walsh for the purposes of developing a one-off PC surfing game. However, the company was able to expand rapidly due to both a vast field of local programmers and Australia's relative paucity of video game development companies (and--at least in part--due to management mistakes at Beam).Beleaguered Infogrames embarked on a large internal rebranding effort in 2003, changing its name to Atari, and Infogrames Melbourne House therefore became Atari Melbourne House... for all of three years, when it was purchased by upstart rival Krome. This made Krome the largest video game development company in Australia, rivaled only by much-smaller development houses like Team Bondi. It has continued localizing and releasing games locally, while developing one or two in-house titles per year.In 2010, Krome scored what seemed to be a coup when it announced it had licensed a large number of classic games for the PC/360-exclusive Game Room platform.",

Astro Boy was their first toy that is based on a TV-character.In 1980 they launched the Gundam plastic model toy series which became a huge success and surpassed 100 million units in cumulative sales in 1984 and 300 million in 1999.In 1978 Bandai Publishing was established and their first electronic game success was LSI Baseball. The Moblie Suit Gundam computer game series became another huge success topping 20 million sales in 2004.Not only has Bandai provided intellectual property that would be used in video games and developed its own video game titles, but Bandai has also attempted to make a couple of forays into the video game console space over their history. In 1994 the company introduced the Playdia a video game console that was only released in Japan. This console's titles mainly consisted of quiz games, anime based video games and multimedia edutainment titles from Bandai properties such as Sailor Moon or Dragon Ball. The system was never released in any other regions and Bandai itself was the only company to support it with software game titles. In 1999, Bandai would introduce the WonderSwan portable gaming device to compete with Nintendo's Game Boy handheld. In fact the device was designed by the original creator of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi. This device did see support from other video game makers over its history.In 2005 Bandai spun off their computer games division and established Bandai Games Inc.",

There is also a newer version, known as VBS2, that adds more realism, added scenarios, amongst other improvements.Bohemia Interactive is a small group of developers based in Prauge, the Czech Republic. The company is lead by a certain Mark Spanel, who is also co-owner of the Bohemia Interactive -- Bohemia Interactive was founded in 1990. The company itself is member of IDEA Games, which functions as the company's consultant and partly as a game publisher. The game development studio was in partnership with Codemasters for a long time but was let loose sometime before the release fo Arma: Armed Assault, the company's first game after Operation Flashpoint.The at-the-time completely unknown and ... company showed by presenting gamers with Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis that the company, in fact, was a prestigious and talented company. By delivering an awesome and realistic warfare experience through their incredible well-received Cold War Crisis they soon set their mark in the warfare simulator genre and has proved this time and time again with releases of official expansion packs to the Operation Flashpoint series and games like ArmA: Armed Assault and ArmA II....Let's just take it back a couple of steps -- back to Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (their debut game). When it was released in 2001, it pretty quickly became best seller in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia and the Czech Republic. It was also one of the highest selling games in the USA that year. Bohemia Interactive followed up with expansions like Resistance, making Operation Flashpoint a long lasting game experience by adding (of course) new gameplay as well as apparent engine updates keeping the game fresh and up to modern times in terms of graphics. In '05, Microsoft gave the go-ahead through Codemasters game studio that Operation Flashpoint was to be specially made to the Xbox. The game didn't reach the huge success on the console platform like it did on PC, but is still considered as a valuable game in the Xbox game library.Sometime before the release of their also well-received ArmA: Armed Assault the small team split up with the publisher Codemasters. Owning the rights for the Operation Flashpoint name, Codemasters later went off to make their own Operation Flashpoint game (later to be known as Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising) and Bohemia interactive created Armed Assault, and later ArmA II. Bohemia Interactive is now working on Arma 3 and Carrier Command: Gaea Mission.September 30, 2010 - Bohemia Interactive finalizes acquisition of three development studios located in the Czech Republic. The studios are: Black Element Software , Altar Games and Centauri Production .Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis - June 2001Operation Flashpoint: Gold Edition (Expansion) - November 2001Operation Flashpoint: Resistance (Expansion) - June 2002Operation Flashpoint: GOTY Edition (Expansion) - November 2002Operation Flashpoint: Elite (Xbox) - October 2005ArmA: Armed Assault - November 2006 / February 2007ArmA: Queen's Gambit (Expansion) - September 2007ArmA II - June 2009Arma II: Operation Arrowhead (Expansion) - June 2010",

By the mid-1960's the company had moved to making plastic moldings, and by 1976  with Arnold Greenberg, the company had gotten into the video game business with the release of the Telstar. Shortly after, Coleco moved into the handheld market which at the time was dominated by Mattel. After a string of competetive and educational handheld releases, Coleco once again dove into the home console market with the Release of the Colecovision in 1982. But due to the video game crash  in 1983, sales for all home consoles fell dramatically especially with the rise of the Personal Computer. To counteract the falling console sales, Coleco released their own version of the personal computer with the Coleco Adam. This ended up being a monumental failure for the company and not even the successes of the Cabbage Patch Kids and ALF dolls could keep the company from going under. In 1988, Coleco filed for Bankruptcy and by 1989 their assets were purchased by another huge toy company, Hasbro. In 2005, the Coleco brand was reintroduced by River West Brands     with the introduction of the Coleco Sonic which contains and emulates 20 Sega Master System and Game Gear games.  ",

    "description": "Legend Entertainment was founded in 1989 by Bob Bates (of Infocom fame) and Mike Verdu. The company's initial games were Infocom-style interactive fiction games using classic gameplay systems but with the addition of graphics and an optional mouse-driven interface.Their first games included the \"Harry Potter meets Animal House\" Spellcasting trilogy and Frederik Pohl's Gateway, based on the novels by the well-known author. Legend went on to develop the notoriously difficult time travel adventure TimeQuest, another humorous fantasy adventure called Eric the Unready, and a sequel to Gateway, Gateway II: Homeworld.In 1993, Legend's style of gameplay evolved to use a purely point & click interface, more similar to modern adventure games than to Infocom text adventures. Like Gateway, most of these titles were based on fantasy and science fiction novels. These titles licensed from books included Companions of Xanth (based on Piers Anthony's Xanth series), Death Gate (based on the series of the same name by Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman), Shannara (based on the series by Terry Brooks), Callahan's Crosstime Saloon (based on the short stories by Spider Robinson) and John Saul's Blackstone Chronicles (based on the horror novels by John Saul).Legend also released two games based on original IP during this period, including the space adventure Mission Critical, and the post-apocalyptic superhero parody Superhero League of Hoboken. Both of these games are notable for including extensive gameplay elements not normally found in adventure games. Mission Critical featured a lengthy strategy section in which the player commands a starship in battle, and Superhero League of Hoboken was structured as a first-person RPG similar to Bard's Tale, with adventure game style puzzle scenes occurring at important locations.During this period, the company also developed Star Control 3, sequel to the much loved Star Control 2 created by Toys for Bob. The game was not well-received by fans and suffered from poor sales.In 1998, the company was acquired by GT Interactive, which was then itself acquired by Infogrames, and for the most part stopped production on the adventure games it had been known for, focusing instead on first-person shooters. Post acquisition, Legend released Wheel of Time, a shooter based on the book series by Robert Jordan, worked on an expansion to seminal shooter Unreal, and developed Unreal II: The Awakening. Unreal II was another sequel that was sadly not well-received, and in 2004, Legend Entertainment was shut down.",

    "description": "Apogee was founded in Texas in 1987. They released their games or parts of their games in \"episodes\". Usually the first one would be free and the additional episodes were to be ordered separately, a business model which became known as shareware. This was a risky business model, considering the Internet had still been in its pioneering stages in the early 90s and the distribution was done via phone and mail. Apogee released many games which are now considered cult classics and pioneers in their respective genres, including Rise of The Triad, Wolfenstein 3-D, Raptor, Wacky Wheels and the Duke Nukem series, which Apogee re-released in 2008, following a long phase of hiatus, for various handheld systems. Some of these games were merely published by Apogee, such as Wolfenstein and Commander Keen, which had been developed by id Software.Apogee planned to create a separate brand for all genres their release strategy might cover, yet it turned out to be unnecessary, as the 3D Realms brand, created for \"3D\" games such as Duke Nukem 3D and Terminal Velocity proved to be the only successful sub-brand that was worth continuation. Later on, the original name Apogee was dropped altogether in favour of the newer, more successful brand that was 3D Realms. Duke Nukem 3D was by far the most successful and appraised game by 3D Realms, however, they released other successful FPS shooters in the form of the Max Payne series and Prey. The last original game to be released by 3D realms as developer and not a publisher however has been Shadow Warrior in 1997.The long awaited sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, called Duke Nukem Forever had been in development for over 12 years and widely considered vaporware by many users and game sites. This lead to a lawsuit being filed by Take Two Interactive who claimed that 3D Realms breached their contractual obligations by not delivering Duke Nukem Forever. Although Duke Nukem Forever was ultimately of significantly low quality upon its exceptionally belated release in 2011, internal sources claim that the studio - despite being smaller than before - is still active and will continue to release games.",

    "description": "id Software circa 1993id Software's history starts at Softdisk, an Apple II disk magazine company. At a board meeting at Softdisk in 1990, John Carmack introduced a groundbreaking technique to develop rapid side-scrolling graphics on a PC. Carmack and co-worker Tom Hall worked through the night developing a replica of the first level of Super Mario Bros. 3 using stock images from co-worker John Romero's game, Dangerous Dave. When Romero saw Carmack and Hall's creation, he knew that Carmack had made something special.Unknown to Softdisk, the three men designed a full carbon copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 on the PC, hoping to license the game to Nintendo. Unfortunately, Nintendo turned down the trio. However, this caught the attention of Scott Miller of Apogee Software. Miller began to contact John Romero through a series of fan letters. Once Romero caught on, Miller realized this was necessary or Softdisk would become aware of the three. Miller suggested the three making shareware games to start out with. They \"borrowed\" the Softdisk computers and started development on platformer, Commander Keen.The game was released on December 14, 1990 and was published by Scott Miller's Apogee Software. Soon after this, Softdisk learned of the three's plans. However, they were able to reach an agreement. Carmack, Hall and Romero were able to get away with it and form their own studio if they provided a game for Softdisk every 2 months. The three agreed and on February 1, 1991, id Software was born.Hovertank - id's first FPS gameid first sold their games in the same way they sold Commander Keen, through shareware distribution with Apogee Software. id would start by selling the first title of their trilogies through shareware than sell the next two via mail order. For Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, distinct sequels were created for the retail market (based on the same engine and assets), but starting with Quake the more conventional retail model was adopted from the outset. id quickly became famous for their game engines which were frequently licensed to other developers. After the Keen engine, id would go on to develop the Wolfenstein 3D engine, the Wolfenstein 3D slopes engine, Doom engine, Quake, Quake II and Quake III engines, Doom 3 technology ( id Tech 4), the MegaTexture technology, and the upcoming id Tech 5. Commander Keen was id's first big success. Commander Keen gained a cult following from the gamers and spawned a large series of titles. Wolfenstein 3D was their next big hit and essentially created the 3D first person shooter genre. Wolfenstein 3D was followed by its less successful prequel, Spear of Destiny.After Wolfenstein 3D, id launched its biggest hit yet, Doom. Doom had the best graphics of any PC game to date and garnered mainstream media attention based on its popularity and violent, dark imagery. Doom was followed by the just as successful Doom II, which was technically very similar to the original. 2 years later, id's next hit first person shooter was born, Quake. Quake featured an all new full 3D game engine and the groundbreaking ability to play deathmatch across the internet. Quake spawned three sequels in Quake II, the online-focused Quake III: Arena and a direct follow-up to Quake II, Quake 4. id allowed various developers to revisit their franchises with new adaptions on the series. The first of this was Return to Castle Wolfenstein, developed by Gray Matter Interactive and Nerve Software.Return to Castle Wolfenstein was the first Wolfenstein game with online multiplayer. The next published game was Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, an online-only take on the Wolfenstein series developed by Splash Damage. It was soon revealed that this break was due to id's development on Doom 3 which was released in 2004. Doom 3 once again revolutionized graphics on a PC but received a mixed reception from series fans. id returned to production after Doom 3, collaborating with Raven Software for Quake 4, Fountainhead Studios' cell phone games Doom RPG and Orcs & Elves, and finally, Splash Damage's Quake spin-off, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. They have also released a heavily revised version of Quake 3 Arena as a browser-based game, Quake Live.In 2009, id Software released several of their classic games on the Apple's App Store with ports of Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Rage. They also released new titles like Wolfenstein RPG, Doom Resurrection and Doom II RPG.On October 4, 2011, id released its highly anticipated new IP called Rage that utilized the latest id Tech 5 engine. It was originally to be published by Electronic Arts after id announced a partnership with EA, ending their long exclusive relationship with Activision but was finally published by Bethesda, id's current parent company. Rage received positive reviews but didn't sell well, resulting several employee layoffs on January 10, 2012. Raven Software released a new Wolfenstein game in 2009 but it too didn't do well sales wise, which resulted a major layoff at Raven.Currently, Doom 4 is in the works but neither John Carmack nor Tim Willits is heavily involved with the project.On June 24, 2009, id Software was acquired by Zenimax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. This was considered a surprise move, especially on id's part due to their history as being a staunchly independent developer. The full press release can be found here. Following the acquisition, Bethesda later acquired the publishing rights for Rage, ending the short stint with Electronic Arts. Other companies that were considered to be part of a merger with id were Activision, THQ and Sega, but id chose Bethesda because it \" felt more secure with larger companies.\"Sometime in 2008, id Software established a development team to work on mobile games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Their first release was Wolfenstein RPG in 2009, followed by Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom Classic, Doom: Resurrection, Doom II RPG and Rage HD.In a keynote at QuakeCon 2012, John Carmack revealed that the id Mobile developers have shifted their efforts on bigger projects, thus halting the mobile game development indefinitely.\"id\" used to look like thisThe company was originally called Ideas From the Deep but they decided to shortened it to simply id, which stands for \"in demand,\" and is pronounced as in \"did\" or \"kid.\" The name also had another meaning which is referring to id, one of the three parts (The other two being ego and super-ego) of the brain that behaves by the pleasure principle. Even though id has since moved on, Ideas From The Deep still exists to this day as a mobile gaming company but it no longer has any relationship with id Software.id software is known for its game engines that many developers and games have used. They were primarily created and designed by John Carmack and as an advocate of open-source, he would release the source code on the web for the fans and mods once it has reached its mature stage. From the beginning, Carmack doesn't believe in patenting his game engines and is not interested in licensing them because of his desire to devote his time working on new technology and not to provide technical support to third-party developers constantly.The id Tech 1, 2 and 3 engines were widely licensed by various gaming companies like Raven Software, Valve Corporation, LucasArts, Splash Damage and Human Head Studios. The Half-Life, Call of Duty and Star Wars games were made possible thanks to the id Tech engines. The id Tech 4 was the least popular engine thanks to its biggest competitor Epic Games (creators of the Unreal Engine) that provided better development tools and genre scope. Epic Games approached its gaming licensing seriously and it affected id Software's business to some extend. When asked in a 2011 interview, Carmack said \"good for [Epic Games]\" and despite losing the engine market by a few percentage, he has no regrets of not pursuing the licensing business.The id Tech 5 is the latest engine from id. It supports MegaTexture that provides textures with resolutions up to 128,000 pixels x 128,000 pixels. The first game to utilize the id Tech 5 is Rage.DoomDoom (1993)Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994)Heretic (1994)Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders (1994)Hexen: Beyond Heretic (1995)Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel (1995)Final Doom (1996)Strife (1996)Quake IIQuake (1996)Quake II (1997)Hexen II (1997)Half-Life (1998)SiN (1998)Heretic II (1998)Kingpin: Crime of Life (1999)Daikatana (2000)Soldier of Fortune (2000)Anachronox (2001)Quake III: ArenaQuake III: Arena (1999)Quake III: Team Arena (2000)Star Trek: Voyager (2000)Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001)Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix (2002)Star Wars: Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast (2002)Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy (2003)Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (2003)Call of Duty (2003)Call of Duty: United Offensive (2004)Severity (2007)Dark Salvation (2009)QuakeLive (2010)American McGee's AliceAmerican McGee's Alice (2000)Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.² (2000)Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (2002)Medal of Honor: Allied Assault – Breakthrough (2003)Medal of Honor: Allied Assault – Spearhead (2003)Star Trek: Elite Force II (2003)Doom 3Doom 3 (2004)Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil (2005)Prey (2006)Quake 4 (2005)Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (2007)Wolfenstein (2009)Brink (2011)RageRage (2011)Doom 3: BFG Edition (2013) [using id Tech 5 elements]Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014)The Evil Within (2014)Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (2015)Doom 4 (TBA)Marooned On Mars (1990)The Earth Explodes (1990)Keen Must Die!

They have also worked on the Kirby franchise, developing Kirby: Squeak Squad and Kirby & The Amazing Mirror. Flagship has since been shut down, and all former employees have been merged into Capcom's primary studio.Clover Studio Co., Ltd. - Clover Studio was a development studio of Capcom that worked on many cult games. They are the developers behind the Viewtiful Joe franchise, with every game in the series developed by them. They also worked on two popular PlayStation 2 games: Okami and God Hand. The studio has since been shut down, and many of its remaining members have gone on to form PlatinumGames.The Street Fighter franchise is one of Capcom's most popular.From the founding of Capcom, they have developed many of the gaming industry's most popular and longest running franchises. In their early days, developing games for the arcade, Capcom began many franchises that are still going on today. Their first game was released in 1984, Vulgus, but the rest of their early arcade games were scrolling shooters. 1942 is a scrolling shooter franchise that Capcom created during this period. Later, in 1987, Capcom released the original Street Fighter. The franchise was not very well-received until its sequel was released in 1991, Street Fighter II. Street Fighter II is one of the most famous games of all time, spawning several updates (for example, Super Street Fighter II, Hyper Street Fighter II, etc.). The Street Fighter franchise is one of the most recognizable fighting franchises, and is one of Capcom's major successes.Mega Man, of the ultra-popular Mega Man franchise.Also in 1987, Capcom released the first Mega Man on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Mega Man franchise has recently released the tenth game in the original franchise, and has several other side-stories, such as Mega Man Zero, Mega Man X, and Mega Man Battle Network. Another one of Capcom's hit franchises was released in the arcade in 1989. Final Fight was a side-scrolling beat-em-up and was later released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which helped to popularize the franchise. One of Capcom's first attempts at the RPG genre was Breath of Fire, in 1994 on the SNES. It has also had many sequels, including Breath of Fire II on the SNES as well. It was well-received by most, but the series isn't quite as popular as many of Capcom's larger franchises.In 1996, Capcom began another incredibly popular franchise. The PlayStation saw the release of the first Resident Evil (known as Biohazard in Japan), a survival horror game. The series has since seen many sequels, such as the well-known Resident Evil 4 and the upcoming Resident Evil 5. Capcom's in-house development teams, such as Flagship, Clover Studio, and Capcom Studio 8 (who handled the development of the Maximo franchise and Final Fight: Streetwise) have also helped create many popular, but more obscure, games (more prominently Okami and Viewtiful Joe). In addition, Flagship has helped with the development of the Legend of Zelda franchise, with Legend of Zelda: Orcale of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, and Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. Flagship was closed, however, with their last title being Kirby: Squeak Squad. Clover Studio was closed as well, but some of their employees went on to found PlatinumGames.Capcom has many popular intellectual properties, as they are one of the largest software companies in the world. These franchises include Final Fight, Okami, Darkstalkers, Marvel vs. Capcom, Captain Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Bionic Commando, Phoenix Wright, Lost Planet, Dead Rising, Zack & Wiki, and Strider.The Yashichi in Mega Man, where it fully restores all weapon power.Capcom's first mascot was Captain Commando (note that the first three letters of each word forms the word \"CapCom\"), from the game Captain Commando as well as the NES game Section Z. He has gone on to appear in many of Capcom's fighting games, including Marvel vs. Capcom. Mega Man is now considered to be Capcom's mascot, because of the large amount of games in the franchise and the popularity of the franchise. Ryu, from Street Fighter, could also be considered one of Capcom's mascot, but Ryu is more thought of as the face of the Street Fighter franchise.The Yashichi is an item that appears in many of Capcom's games. Usually, it acts as health restoration or a power-up. It is a red circle that has something resembling a pinwheel on it. The Yashichi was first in Capcom's very first game, Vulgus, as an enemy, and has gone on to appear in Mega Man and many other games (albeit with a more helpful role).",

Then on March 31, 2006, Namco merged with Bandai's video game operations and the US arm of the company was renamed Namco Bandai Games Inc. Meanwhile, the Japanese arm went by Bandai Namco Games, to take advantage of Bandai's larger Japanese precense while capitalizing on the still-recognizable Namco name in the United States. In 2014, the US arm was renamed to Bandai Namco Games America Inc, unifying the names across regions. Bandai Namco Games announced in December 2014 that it would rename itself again and thus would known globally as Bandai Namco Entertainment starting April 1, 2015.Some of the company's most famous games are Pac-Man and the Tekken franchise. They also own a patent to make minigames during loading screens.Bandai, before merging with Namco, had previously attempted to release its own video game console devices. In 1995 Bandai released the Pippin with Apple in Japan, and released in the USA in 1996. Bandai did have better succes with the WonderSwan handheld game system in Japan in 1999. A year later the company released the WonderSwan Color. Both portables saw support from Bandai itself and even from other third party software vendors such as Square, Capcom and Taito, but ultimately the WonderSwan was defeated in the market by the Game Boy and the Neo Geo Pocket.",

This caused unrest with the company's fans, however Shinichi Suzuki, CEO of Atlus stated that, \"Atlus will continue to provide the finest quality game experiences possible.\"In 2013, it became apparent that Index was in severe financial debt, and had doctored their accounting in an effort to hide this fact. As a result, the company was forced into sale. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that Sega Sammy Holdings purchased Index Corporation, Atlus, and all of Atlus's intellectual properties. Atlus now exists as a subsidiary of Sega.The official mascot of Atlus is Jack Frost from the Shin Megami Tensei franchise.Beyond video games, Atlus is best known as the co-inventor, along with Sega, of the purikura arcade booth, or photo sticker booth, which is hugely popular in Asia, especially among female audiences.

    "description": "Psygnosis was founded in 1984 in Liverpool, United Kingdom by Ian Hetherington and Jonathan Ellis. Over the course of its existence, Psygnosis released more than 100 games for many platforms, pushing the boundaries of all systems and platforms, dedicating themselves to creating and publishing games which feature cutting edge technology and game design. Before joining Sony and the Playstation armada, Psygnosis created many critically acclaimed and successful games for home computer systems, such as Lemmings, Blood Money, Shadow of the Beast and Microcosm.Psygnosis was aquired by Sony in 1993 and was one of the dominant forces in establishing the standing of the Playstation in the gaming industry, by contributing games such as Wipeout and Destruction Derby to the first wave of Playstation releases in 1995. By 2000, Psygnosis decided to feature on the console market, ceasing to create games for the PC and were incorporated into Sony and renamed SCEE Studio Liverpool.Sony announced on August 22, 2012 that they were closing SCEE Studio Liverpool.In 1999, Psygnosis published Drakan: Order of the Flame which was developed by Surreal Software. The game received mixed reviews, but became the center of a small controversy when the editorial staff at PC.IGN received a letter from Psygnosis PR which discussed Psygnosis' opinion that PC.IGN was not an editorially sound body. The full letter reads:Dear Trent,With Drakan topping the SoftTrend charts at #2 in August and with sales of the game moving very strongly forward it is sad that we have to write to inform you that we think IGN's review of Drakan, even with a fairly decent score, does not reflect what we deemed IGN to be on the editorial caliber scale, both in style and in content - nor does it reflect an awareness of actual consumer opinion as seen in the actual sales of the game.Rather, the review of Drakan is quite demeaning and juvenile sounding, stooping lower than PCXL while really missing the whole point of the game. Unfortunately, we have to tell you that the message we get from the both the beginning and end of this review seems to focus only on the female body, to put it nicely. We're aware of the audience that IGN is targeting, so why even the negative feel from the beginning of the review? While some of the gameplay comments are good and fair in between, there is a hefty amount of contradiction and way too much personal interjection. In particular, the ridiculous 'Cleavage' interview at the end is very tacky, or to be more blunt, really stupid. Oh please!From a PR and marketing perspective, we're really tired of such subjective points of view, editorial that ignores the general consumer perspective and fails to commend a game like Drakan that breaks out of genre, graphic and gameplay barriers. Where's the informative content for your readers? Are they really that dense?As you're probably aware, the review has been posted at EBworld.com and what's even more disconcerting is that there is no score on this page so visitors are only reading discrepant editorial. So, while I'm being banged away at both by an irate developer and senior marketing exec, I also must agree that we can no longer provide editorial content, exclusive opportunities and review materials if this is what we get for a top-selling game.We have asked that EB take down this review on their site. Do you think this review will really sell more copies of Drakan? If you would like to help us then perhaps you can also take steps to have the review removed from the EB site.It would be fair and considerate to hear back from you. We realize that you can't answer all the irate emails from publishers about reviews you've posted but this one, we think, warrants an appropriate response.Regards,Psygnosis PRIt is worth noting that the overall score that PC.IGN gave to Drakan was an 8.1 out of 10. IGN published both the full letter from Psygnosis, as well as a response which read:Forward: Normally, we would respond to this letter in private, but since the email was forwarded to our superiors, our coworkers, and even our sales staff, we felt it necessary to respond in kind.Congratulations on Drakan's continued success. As we said in the review, it was a fun game that we really enjoyed playing, and even recommended to our audience. With that said, we are sorry that you did not find the \"editorial caliber\" of our review to be up to your standards. We suspect that you are not defining editorial caliber the same way we do � a thorough and unbiased examination of the good and bad points of a product. Judging by your letter, it seems your definition of caliber is strongly tied to sales as a benchmark for excellence. The history of PC software is littered with titles that were lambasted by the critics, but enjoyed great sales. Myst, Deer Hunter, and Rebel Assault come to mind immediately, but as you can see from our review, we do not include Drakan in that list.Your criticism causes us some confusion. As the focus of the game seemed to be very much on selling the sexual appeal of a scantily clad leather-bound woman, a la' Lara Croft, we find it ironic that you accuse us of sounding \"demeaning and juvenile\" when the review that you seem to object to is devoted to our views on your juvenile and demeaning portrayal of a female protagonist. It's not that we don't understand why you would have a character like this; after all, it's proved very lucrative for games like Tomb Raider and SiN, but we find it unnerving that you would try and deny the intentional (and blatant) sexualization of your heroine. Are you trying to suggest that this is historical for the time period, or that the character design was a complete coincidence?Furthermore, we'd like to think of all of our reviews as being from a subjective viewpoint, so subjective in fact that readers will actually respect our opinions. Our readers are not dense. When they read a review, they expect to hear whether the money that they spend on a new product will be something that will keep them entertained, not whether or not it will make them part of a large group of buyers. If we started reviewing the games in the manner that you suggest, we'd be out of a job very quickly.What it seems like you're suggesting is that you expect positive coverage in exchange for \"editorial content, exclusive opportunities and review materials.\" We don't agree to such demands, and furthermore, we don't appreciate such threats. Our review scores will remain the same whether or not we receive free copies of your game in the mail. Just as you would think it unfair for us to give the game a bad review if you didn't send us press materials, it's not fair to our audience to score a game higher than it deserves purely in the interest of the beating out the competition.We're not sure whether our review will really sell more copies of Drakan, and in fact, that's not really our job here at IGNPC. Our job is talk about and review games from an unbiased and independent perspective, just like movie, music, theater, restaurant, or any other sort of artistic analysis. EB World has already made the decision to carry our reviews, both good and bad, as a resource for their consumers, even though it could theoretically affect their sales. We respect EB World's integrity in this matter, and we find it hard to believe that you can't as well.But all of this is beside the point. We liked Drakan. We gave it a high rating, placing it amongst such peers as Starfleet Command and Tiberian Sun. If your complaints are truly about the mockery of the character you've created to sell your games, then perhaps you shouldn't have made a character with such blatantly disproportionate sexuality.And thank you for the comparison to PCXL. We enjoy the magazine, and wish it continued success. As for referring to our interview with cleavage as stupid, we prefer to think of that as very blunt.Sincerely,-- IGN StaffNotably, future valve writers Chet Faliszek and Erik Wolpaw became involved in the controversy via their website Old Man Murray. They initially published an article that was extremely sardonic and highly critical of Psygnosis' letter (This article: http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/723.html) .

ATD was formed in September, 1998 by a group of graduates from Birmingham university, as well as working on games they also created some development tools and designed electronic parts for arcade machines. The company worked out of converted barns in the countryside of Warwickshire and at one time had 75 empoyees working at the studio. The original five founding members are; Chris Gibbs, Fred Gill, Martin Green, Jon Steele and Jim Torjussen. Attention to Detail developed many games that have gained a cult status and had significantly more success in Europe than it ever did in America. The company went out of business on August 28, 2003.The first games that the company developed were Cybermorph and Battlemorph for the Atari Jaguar, the games gained the ATD little attention as a developer and cybermorph was panned by most critics despite being a pack in game for the system. In March, 1997 Attention to Detail joined GBH which gave it the opportunity to develop the official games for the winter and standard Olympics, Sydney 2000 and Salt Lake City 2002. The company achieved it's greatest success with Rollcage for the original Playstation, the game was well received both critically and commercially and allowed them to create the follow up Rollcage: Stage II, they also created a more child friendly game with many of the same mechanics called Firebugs. After the relative success of the Rollcage franchise, ATD was allowed to work with the LEGO license to create Lego Racers 2 and Drome Racers. In 2001 a LEGO racers ride was opened at LEGOLAND in Windsor that was actually designed by Attention to Detail. Drome racers was the last game they ever developed though they were credited in the 2007 release, LEGO Racers & LEGO Racers 2 for their original work on the sequel.",

    "description": "Take-Two (officially Take-Two Interactive Software) is an American video game publisher and developer headquartered in New York City. The company owns many development studios, most notably Rockstar North, the creators of the popular Grand Theft Auto franchise. Take-Two has published and developed many popular IPs including; Grand Theft Auto, Bioshock, Midnight Club, Mafia, Bully, Manhunt, NBA 2K, MLB 2K, NHL 2K, and many more. Take-Two maintains development studios in Scotland, London, Vancouver, Toronto, Novato, San Diego among other locations. Take-Two was founded in 1993, and has since become one of the top publishers in the game industry.In 1993 Take-Two published one of its first major games, Biosys, a PC adventure game, set in an artificial biosphere facility. The company's next major historical event was in 2005, when it created its present day publishing arms, 2K Sports and 2K Games, in order to offer more concentrated management for its increasing portfolio of game genres. Take-Two acquired the rights to the 2K sports license, the baseball and hockey sports from Kush Games and the football and basketball sports from Visual Concepts, as well as the rights to the Civilization franchise. The following year, in 2005, Take-Two acquired a number of videogame developers. The company purchased the development house of Irrational Games for approximately $11.4 million, as well as, the development studios Kush Game and Visual Concepts for $32 million. Later that year, it purchased Firaxis for $27 million.On May 2007, Take-Two agreed to a deal with Oasys Mobile for the introduction of the Sid Meier franchise to the mobile phone market, developed by Firaxis Games, which had been purchased by Take-Two two years before. In March of that same year, Take-Two filed a lawsuit against happiness hater Jack Thompson, in order to halt him from filing a public nuisance in the State of Florida. In September 8, 2008 Take-Two signed an agreement with Ditan Distribution LLC, in which it, Ditan Distribution, agrees to the role of packaging, shipping, and storage functions which Take-Two had previously done by its self through its subsidiary Jack of All Games.Two pieces that didn't fitIn February of 2008, rival publisher Electronic Arts offered an acquisition deal of Take-Two Interactive Software for approximately two billion dollars. The offer was declined by Take-Two's board of directors. Electronic Arts was not sufficed with a negative on the deal, and so it tried to persuade the company by threatening Take-Two that if it did not accept the offer it would attempt a \"hostile\" take over by convincing Take-Two's shareholders of accepting the deal. The Take-Two board of directors spent an undisclosed amount of money convincing its own shareholders not to accept Electronic Arts' proposal. The shareholders did not sell their stocks in the company, and by September 2008, Electronic Arts let go of the proposal and said in a statement that it had allowed the the two billion dollar proposal expire. In the end, Electronic Arts' hostile take over bid of Take-Two Interactive Software ultimately failed.2K (2K Games, 2K Sports, 2K Play) - Headquarted in Novato, California, USARockstar Games - Headquartered in New York, New York, USA",

They have developed many well known games, including R-Type, the earliest known \"beat-em-up\" game, Kung-Fu Master, and many other well known games and franchises.Originally a manufacturer of arcade cabinets, IPM released many arcade cabinets between 1974 and 1978. In 1979, IPM changed their name to IREM Corporation. IREM was an acronym for International Rental Electronics Machines, but that was changed in the 1980s to Innovations in Recreational Electronic Media. Irem continued strong until the 1990s. Sales began to fall, and the corporation began to fall apart. People left Irem, including the arcade cabinet department (forming off a separate company known as Apies), and many employees went on to form Nazca Corporation (creator of the Metal Slug franchise). However, in 1997 Nanao founded the Irem Software Engineering, Inc., which took control of the remainder of Irem Corporation.Irem was a strong supporter of Sony's PlayStation Home, developing Spaces, clothing, decorations, and Home-integrated game lobbies.In the aftermath of the 2011 Touhoku Earthquake Irem canceled two high profile PS3 titles: Bumpy Trot 2 and Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4. Shortly afterwards the director of both games, Kazuma Kujo, left with many key staff to form Granzella inc. Following this Irem removed most of its PlayStation Home spaces and began delisting all non-pachislot games from the PSN, XBLA, and WiiWare services; a process that was finished in August of 2012. According to Kujo this is because he was the primary force behind making games at Irem, and the remaining staff wish to focus only on pachislot.",

    "description": "Alex SeropianBungie was founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian, and Jason Jones as a development house for the Macintosh. Their first game, Gnop!, was a freeware Pong clone for the Mac, although you could pay $15.00 for the source code. Bungie went on to release Operation Desert Storm, and Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. These were followed by the Marathon series ( First-Person space shooters) and the Myth series (Real-Time Fantasy Tactics).The team started working on their next project, Halo: Combat Evolved, which was originally a Sci-fi Real Time Strategy game. During its development, it was changed to a third-person shooter and was scheduled to be released for theJason JonesMac and PC. Bungie’s plans had changed though as they were acquired by Microsoft in 2000, and Halo would become an exclusive game for their first entry to the console market, the Xbox. The game changed once again to a first-person shooter, and was a launch title for the Xbox. The game broke many sales records, and was critically acclaimed as one of the best games of all time. The game was (much) later ported to the PC and Mac as Halo: Custom Edition. Following Halo: Combat Evolved's success, Bungie went to work on Halo 2, concentrating on multiplayer and Xbox Live functionality. The game was released in November of 2004, breaking many sales records that the original had held. It was praised for its multiplayer, and was the most played Xbox Live game for many years, remaining popular even after the release of the new Xbox 360 console, right up until the service dropped compatibility with original Xbox games on April 15th, 2010. There were criticisms about the short single player campaign and its notorious cliffhanger ending, causing mixed opinions about whether it was better than the original or not.Bungie’s next title was the highly anticipated Halo 3 , the first in the series to be released on the new Xbox 360. Once again, Bungie received critical acclaim and record-breaking sales, making Halo 3 the best-selling game of 2007, with 8.1 million units sold. The game was followed up in 2009 with Halo 3: ODST, which was set during the timeline of Halo 2 and used the Halo 3 engine. Bungie has since released Halo: Reach, a prequel set before Halo: Combat Evolved, originally announced at E3 2009, which covers the destruction of the planet Reach. The multiplayer beta was the game went live on May 3rd, 2010 and was accessible through an option on the Halo 3: ODST campaign disc. The game proper was released on September 14, 2010. Reach was Bungie's final and entry in the Halo, and control of the Halo franchise has been passed to Microsoft-created 343 Industries.Bungie has recently signed a 10-year exclusive partnership with Activision. They have also planned to release their \"next big action game universe\" under Activision. Bungie still remains an independent company and will continue to own their intellectual property.Following the earthquake in Japan, Bungie (in association with Amazon) began selling wristbands ($5.00) to help aid the Japanese relief effort. All money for the wristbands goes directly to the Red Cross.On June 30th, 2011, during their extended 20th anniversary celebrations, Bungie announced details on their newest effort, Bungie Aerospace. The program, set to launch later in the summer, is a attempt to break into the mobile gaming market by teaming up with a selection of independent developers and releasing games on both the iOS and Android platforms. Their first game, Crimson, is being developed by Harebrained Schemes, a company headed by the man behind the famous Halo 2 ARG, \"I Love Bees\".In November 2012, details were leaked to IGN about Bungie's next project, Destiny. Bungie officially unveiled the game on February 17, 2013 by releasing a video documentary showcasing concept art and other high concept designs. The game will be an online only experience that allows players to group up and take on various missions similar to an MMO.",

    "description": "3D Realms is a video game developer and publisher based in Garland, Texas, formally known as Apogee Software Ltd. They have been responsible for a number of very successful game series, most notably the Duke Nukem and Max Payne franchises.As well as developing and publishing their own games, 3D Realms also published games for other companies including Activision and id Software amongst others.Apogee Software was founded by Scott Miller in 1987 with the release of Kingdom of Kroz. During the next couple of years they released about ten games, none which were as successful as Kingdom of Kroz. In 1991 George Broussard stepped in as co-owner of the company, and he brought with him some of his previously developed games, such as Pharaoh's Tomb. But none of his previous games can compare to the game that made this man known, Duke Nukem.Apogee Software, Ltd.Apogee didn't only develop games, they also published them. While publishing their own games they also had deals with other studios, most notably id Software. Although Apogee published several classic games for id Software, Commander Keen and Wolfenstein 3D, the developers severed their ties with Apogee for their 1993 release, Doom.Apogee's marketing model was different from the major developers, they relied heavily on the shareware method. Their first games were completely free, asking the customer to pay if he/she enjoyed the game. This proved to be less profitable than they had planed so they developed their own version of the shareware method, by dividing their games into episodes they would release the first one for free, and the customer would order the next ones via mail-order. This marketing model was so successful that it was adopted by other major companies, such as Activision and Epic Games.As the years went by, Apogee saw that 3D games began catching on and they saw this as an opportunity to create a second developer, 3D Realms. The purpose behind this decision was to let 3D Realms develop 3D games, while Apogee remained a 2D developer. 3D Realms released their first game, the highly successful Duke Nukem 3D in 1996. That same year marked the death of the Apogee name, by the late 90's 2D games was considered old fashion and outdated, and the Apogee name was associated with these kind of games, so they decided to drop the Apogee name and only use 3D Realms. The last game released under the Apogee name is Stargunner in 1996.After 1998 3D Realms became more of a publisher than a games developer, many unfinished games were outsourced or sold to other studios, including Descent: Freespace and Prey. Prey was originally developed by 3D Realms, but several years of delay led to the game being outsourced to Interplay who released the game in 2006, after being in development for 11 years. 3D Realms also struck a deal with Remedy, to co-produce their new 3rd person-shooter, Max Payne and its sequel Max Payne 2. But despite the fact that several of these games were critically acclaimed and sold well, there is one game that overshadows them all.Duke Nukem Forever was first publicly announced in April 1997 with a release date set during the summer of 1998, fans of the Duke Nukem series were ecstatic. It was supposed to be based on the Quake II engine but soon after Epic Games released their Unreal engine and the team decided to make the switch, because the Unreal engine was better at rendering the vast open spaces needed for some of the levels. In mid June 1998 developer George Broussard announced that the game would be severely delayed because of the engine switch, but this was only the first of many delays.From the 2007 trailerBy 2003 the game had retreated to the shadows, only surfacing now and then to release a new screenshot or a teaser trailer, but no news on development progress or release date were announced. It became known that only 18 people were currently working on the game, one former employee stated that the game was far from finished and would definitely not be released any time soon.In 2007 a new trailer emerged, the first one in six years, when asked when the game would be released Broussard replied, \"When it's done.\"By 2008 the game were nearing completion but a lack of funding held it back. Having spent more than $20 million of their own money Broussard and Miller went to the publisher, Take-Two asking for more, while Take-Two initially agreed to invest $6 million they later lowered the amount to $2.5 million. Broussard refused this offer, and on May 6, 2009 he suspended all development on the project. The final nail in the coffin came only two days later, when the team working on the game were laid off. Development of Duke Nukem Forever was subsequently handed to Gearbox Software, known for Borderlands among other titles, and released in June 2011 to mostly tepid reviews.In September 2012, 3D Realms announced they were utilizing crowd sourcing to fund a new game tentatively titled No More Earth.On March 3rd 2014, Danish investment firm SDN Invest, the part-owner of Interceptor Entertainment, announced their acquisition of 3D Realms. The new studio, now in Denmark, is working on new games, preserving development materials from old games, and investing in other indie developers.",

In October of 1977, the company shorted its name to Tehkan and eventually changed its business to amusement machines, making and selling things such as UFO catchers and pachinko machines, and later arcade machines.Before the business change, there was another company that specialized in yachts and other boats named Japan Yacht Ltd. established on July 7, 1967. This company also dove into electronics with arcade games and eventually changed its name to Tehkan Electronics Ltd. on December 6, 1982, and shorted it to just Tehkan Ltd. on April 19, 1985.Two months later, both Tehkan companies combined into one with the new company's main focus becoming arcade games while still creating other amusement machines. Since the company became primarily known for its video games, the founding date is normally cited with the Japan Yacht Ltd.'s establishment.

    "description": "Codemasters' current logoCodemasters is one of the longest running British video game developers. Currently the CEO is Rod Cousens (formerly of Acclaim) . In 2005, Codemasters was named as the top independent games developer by Develop Magazine, an international monthly journal for video game developers.The co-founders, Richard and David Darling, were both appointed Commanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours 2008 for services to the computer games industry.Dizzy was one of Codemasters' most popular characters.Founded in 1985 by Richard and David Darling (who worked previously for Mastertronic), Codemasters quickly established themselves in the growing ZX Spectrum market. Richard and David mostly associated themselves with action games that required the player to solve simple puzzles by combining different objects. One of the best examples of these games is the Dizzy series. While Codemasters found their roots in the ZX Spectrum, they did not exclusively write for this one computer--they also released software (including the Dizzy series) for the Enterprise 128, Vic 20, Commodore 64, Commodore 16, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST.As the 8-bit computer market diminished, Codemasters turned to developing for the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets, as well as moving away from their budget title legacy to more full-price games on the 16-bit computers 1993 saw the last title in the budget Dizzy series, Crystal Kingdom Dizzy, although they released a full-price Dizzy game, Fantastic Dizzy later. They had major success with the Micro Machines series and Pete Sampras Tennis on the Sega Mega Drive. Both franchises featured the J-Cart, allowing two extra controllers to be attached to the game cart without requiring Electronic Arts' four way play or SEGA's four player adapter.Codemasters' logo from 1986 to 1991.They were famous for releasing a long series of games called \"Advanced Something Simulator\" or \"Professional Something Simulator\". This led to the parody \"Advanced Lawnmower Simulator\" being developed, praised to the skies and then published by Your Sinclair magazine as an April Fool's Day stunt. Codemasters were one of a number of software houses in the 1980s that only released low retail price titles. Hence, when in 1992, they began to cut down on the budget releases in favour of full-price titles, they attracted the ire of many fans and the gaming press, the latter questioning the commercial logic behind it as Codemasters had known a great deal of success from their budget titlesThe long-running Colin McRae franchiseIn the last three years Codemasters have since continued to release titles for later generation systems, such as the TOCA Touring Car series, Colin McRae Rally series, Brian Lara Cricket series and Operation Flashpoint. They currently own the rights to use the title Operation Flashpoint 2: Dragon Rising, but have parted with the original developer Bohemia Interactive Studio. In spite of this, Codemasters released Operation Flashpoint: Elite developed by Bohemia, for Xbox in October 2005. June 2006 saw the long awaited release of Sensible Soccer 2006.In April 2007, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group entered into a game distribution agreement with CodeMasters, Inc. to distribute the company's titles in North America ending May 2008.The logo didn't change again until 2007In June 2007 Codemasters were purchased by equity group Balderton Capital and they changed their logo to an interlocked metallic C and M. Later that month they released the latest in the Colin McRae Rally series, DiRT. They have recently published Overlord and Clive Barker's Jericho.Nanostray 2 is one of the games that Majesco and Codemasters joint-published.On March 2008, Codemasters announced a new deal with Majesco. The new partnership with Majesco will focus on titles for DS and Wii, including Nanostray 2, Toy Shop, Cake Mania 2 and Nancy Drew: The Mystery of the Clue Bender Society for DS, and Wild Earth: African Safari, Our House and Cake Mania for Wii.On May 9, 2008, Codemasters announced that they had won the rights to the Formula One license after Sony's deal ran out. Codemasters will release Formula One 2009 for the Nintendo Wii and Sony PSP in October 2009. It was also announced they would release Formula One 2010 in mid 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Games for Windows Live using the same graphics engine as was used on GRID.",

    "description": "New World Computing was a developer and publisher of RPG and strategy games.  Their work was primarily on computer platforms but some of their titles have been ported to early consoles as well.  The company was originally founded in Agoura Hills, California in 1984 by John Van Caneghem, his wife Michaela Van Caneghem and Mark Caldwell.  A few of their titles were published by other companies but the vast majority of their titles were self-published, a practice that was more common in that period (with the exception of everything developed after their acquisition by 3DO which were all published by that company.)  Their catalog consisted of a number of different titles (many of them one-offs) but they are most famous for the lengthy Might & Magic series of RPGs (which has 9 titles in the core series and several additional series) and its subsequent turn-based strategy spin-off series, Heroes of Might & Magic.The company met with significant success which led to them being acquired by NTN Communications (now known as NTN Buzztime, famous for their bar video trivia system) and then in 1996, they were sold to The 3DO Company for approximately $13MUS.  The New World Computing imprint was kept and they continued to operate under 3DO's banner as a creatively independent studio.  The 3DO Company began a string of financial difficulties in the years that followed.  Their 3DO console platform was a huge failure and after that, they tried to refocus on software publishing.  Despite the continued success of New World Computing's titles, they were not enough to stem 3DO's losses and on April 15, 2002, it was announced that a large portion of the studio's staff were being laid off.  3DO's fortunes continued to decline and the company entered chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May, 2003.  Unable to secure new funding and unable to find a buyer for the studio, the intellectual property rights to the Might & Magic and Heroes of Might & Magic franchises were sold to Ubisoft for a mere $1.3MUS and the New World Computing studio was dissolved with the rest of The 3DO Company.Ubisoft has since released three titles with these properties, Dark Messiah of Might & Magic, Dark Messiah of Might & Magic:  Elements (a console adaptation of the previous game with some different content) and Heroes of Might & Magic V.  These titles have very little to do with the original series they are based on, save sharing the name.In 2004, Jon Van Caneghem joined NCsoft where he worked until 2005.  On September 25, 2006, he announced that he was forming a new company called Trion World Network which is currently working on several projects, including a new fantasy MMO with Van Caneghem leading the project.",

They were owned by IJE, a company that owned the licensing rights to produce electronic versions of said quiz shows and had decided to publish the games themselves after noting the success others were having with game show adaptations. Later on GameTek would extend their boundaries and release games of any genre, often taking European games and publishing them in the US. In addition, they created a subsidiary, Cybersoft, which published games for the Super Nintendo platform.In 1995, GameTek announced Robotech: Crystal Dreams, a game based on the anime Robotech for the Nintendo 64. The game received much interest due to its long development cycle, eventually being canceled when GameTek filed for bankruptcy in 1997. After GameTek's bankruptcy some of its assets were acquired by Take Two Interactive. GameTek is, as of now, defunct.",

    "description": "Color Dreams was a game developer in the late 80s, early 90s. What separated Color Dreams from the rest of the companies developing for the NES was the fact that they chose to develop these games with no official license from Nintendo.  The company was able to to still make these games, even without the license, because the company itself reverse engineered the NES to figure out a way to work around the systems \"lock out\" chip. This was the chip that Nintendo used to prevent unlicensed companies from making working cartridges.  The first of these unlicensed games was released in 1989 and was called Baby Boomer. Other titles that came out later include Captain Comic, Crystal Mines and Robo Demons.  Even though Color Dreams was able to bypass Nintendo's \"lock out\" chip, the games did not always work with the NES. This problem damaged the companies reputation and forced the company to make a new branch of the company called Bunch Games so that they can continue to create the same quality games without damaging the main companies reputation any further.  In 1991 Color Dreams created another branch company called Wisdom Tree was created to release Christianity-themed games. Wisdom Tree released Color Dreams most popular games while it was part of Color Dreams. Wisdom Tree eventually split from Color Dreams when they went out of business in the mid 90s. Wisdom Tree continues to release religious games to this day.",

    "description": "The company that currently bears the Atari brand name and logo is officially Atari SA, formerly known as Infogrames Entertainment SA. (IESA). In October 2008 Infogrames completed the purchase of Atari, Inc., buying out all remaining public shares of the company for a total of $11 million making Atari, Inc. a privately held company and a fully owned subsidiary of Infogrames SA. All Atari subsidiaries were now held buy the holding company Infogrames SA. In May 2009 IESA announced that it would be changing its name to Atari SA. to remove the confusion surrounding the Atari and Infogrames brands.Atari SA., based in France now acts as a holding company for all the remaining Atari subsidiaries, (known collectively as Atari Group) the largest being Atari, Inc. based in the U.S. which accounted for more than 80% of consolidated revenue for the fiscal year 2009/2010.Divisions of Atari SA include:Cryptic Studios (sold to Perfect World Entertainment in 2011)Atari London StudioEden GamesAtari Interactive, Inc.Atari, Inc. (a new subsidiary, not to be confused with the original Atari, Inc.)On April 19th, 2010 Atari, S.A. announced Nolan Bushnell, the founder of the original Atari company, along with Tim Virden would join the company's Board of Directors.Infogrames Entertainment Logo.Infogrames Entertainment SA (IESA) was founded by Bruno Bonnell and Christophe Sapet in June 1983, who at the time were at university studying Chemical Engineering. The company was based in Villerbanne, outside Lyon, France. Soon after it was founded, Thomas Schmider joined the company and they started writing programming software. Infogrames started developing family orientated software for the fast developing personal computer market but had also ventured into the video games market. Infogrames quickly established itself as recognized video games developer, albeit in a very new industry by developing and publishing games such as Autoroute Highway and Le Cube Informatique.Early on in the business Infogrames found is difficult to secure funding to grow its video game division due to the reluctance of investors to invest in such a new, risky and untested market. Infogrames continued to grow slowly and by the end of the 1980s it had acquired several licenses such as the popular comic book Tintin, Asterix and Les Tuniques Bleues. It also moved away from the software market and focused solely on developing video games. Infogrames Entertainment's first big success occurred with the release of Tintin on the Moon which helped drive the companies sales passed FFr 100 million mark (est. $20 million).Infogrames quickly began to develop games for new gaming systems currently entering the market such as the SNES and Game Boy. It saw this as a major area of growth for the video games industry as owning a gaming console was much cheaper than a personal computer. However Infogrames continued to develop games for the PC and Macintosh computers. Its early adoption of the Nintendo gaming platform proved fruitful as its video game sales increased dramatically.Infogrames started to invest heavily in research and development to keep up with the ever increasing sophistication of computer technology. This lead to better looking games featuring 3D graphics but also increased development cycles for these games. A game which benefited from this program was Alone in the Dark which took 2 years produce and was released in 1992. This game became an international success and provided instant recognition for the company. A long run of sequels followed for this franchise.Doom.Infogrames was publicly floated in 1993, with a listing on the Paris 'Second Marché' Stock Exchange to fuel its growth and ambition to become one of the world top video game developers. This was very successful for Infogrames and shareholders were lining up to buy a stake in the company. 61 million share requests were made for 115,000 shares available. The major shareholders included Chargeurs Group and Philips Media; a subsidiary for Dutch conglomerate, Phillips. Later that year Infogrames released a line of commercially successful games such as Asterix, Doom, Marco Polo and Myst.In 1994 Infogrames started its international expansion by first creating subsidiaries in major European markets. It created Infogrames Entertainment Benelux in Brussels, Belgium and then aligned with Compagnie Luxembourgeois de Telecommunication (CLT, now RTL group) to from Infogrames Entertainment GmbH, in order to enter the German market. Later than year IESA sold an additional 230,062 shares in the company raising 75,920,460 FF. (est $15 million) By the end of 1994 Infogrames had become the France's largest video game developer beating French rivals Cryo and Ubisoft but was still small in comparison to international giants such as Electronic Arts.Infogrames long term ambition of becoming the world largest video game developer had not diminished and it sought to do so by way of acquisitions. In 1996 it embarked on this acquisition program by purchasing UK based Ocean Software Ltd. for $100 million and subsequently remained it Infogrames UK. This acquisition gave Infogrames the opportunity to extend its software development capacity, access to Ocean's huge licensed video game catalog and most importantly entrance to the American market via Ocean's U.S. subsidiary. By the end of 1996, more than 70 percent of Infogrames' sales came from beyond its home country, taping into the global presence of the video game industry, now reaching total combined sales of $4 billion.The following year Infogrames bought out Philips Media's publishing and distribution business which made IESA, the leading developer, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment software in Europe. It also gained presence in the Australian market by purchasing a majority stake in game distributor Ozesoft, renaming it Infogrames Australia. IESA sort to diversify into the multimedia business and jointly formed Game One with Canal and launch Europe's first dedicated video game TV channel. It also acquired ABS Multimedia, Arcadia and Swiss Gamecity GmbH. With Infogrames previous acquisitions and its ever growing video game library, annual sales topped 1.4 billion FF ($270 million) by the end of its 1998 fiscal year.Even with the recent purchases, IESA did not stop with its quest to dominate the video game industry. It sort to procure smaller sized game development companies in an effort to consolidate what was a highly fragmented industry. In 1999 it raised a further 600 million FF (est. $115 million) through share sales and acquired graphics design company Psygnosis Paris, Australian Beam Software; renaming it Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd, United Kingdom's Gremlin Interactive and US based Interplay and Acolade Inc. IESA also increased it global reach by adding distribution houses in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Scandinavia, Spain and Switzerland.Later that year Infogrames made its most important acquisition to date, with the purchase of U.S. based GT Interactive, (Good Times or GTI) a major game publisher and distributor who had popular hits such as Duke Nukem, Driver and Unreal Tournament. This acquisition tripled Infogrames workforce cost the company $210 million including GTI's current debt. Infogrames also acquired all GTI's assets including development studios such as MacSoft, WizardWorks, Humongous Entertainment, Legend Entertainment and Reflections Interactive. GT Interactive was later renamed Infogrames, Inc and became IESA's North American subsidiary. With this acquisition IESA became the second largest video game developer and publisher in the video game industry.Infogrames continued to expand its business in the multimedia sector by purchasing a 50% stake in Canal Multimedia and entered the expanding mobile telephone market. It continued to purchase more video game companies such a Texas based Paradigm Entertainment, Den-O-Tech and formed a joint venture with Japan's Hudson Soft Co. Ltd. By the end of the decade IESA's revenue topped $850 million and the company was preparing for a new era in the video game industry with the arrival of new generation video game consoles that included the Nintendo GameCube, Sony PlayStation 2, and Microsoft Xbox.2001 was the year when Infogrames first began its association with Atari which would eventually lead to the complete re-branding of the company.Atari's revamped logo.Infogrames purchased Hasbro Interactive from Hasbro for $100 million. Included in the sale were all rights to Hasbro Interactive's properties and subsidiaries including Atari Corporation - the original Atari company - which was at that time owned by Hasbro Interactive. This gave Infogrames exclusive rights to games franchises such as Civilization and Dungeons and Dragons. Hasbro Interactive was later renamed Infogrames Interactive, Inc. and Atari Corporation became Atari Interactive, Inc. which was a subsidiary wholly owned by Infogrames Interactive, Inc. At this time the Atari brand was not being actively used to promote Infogrames as a company or its various rights and properties.2002 saw more publishing deals and acquisitions. First was a deal with BioWare Corp where Infogrames gained exclusive publishing rights for RPG game, Neverwinter Nights. Then in April IESA purchased Eden Studios based in France, popular for game titles such as V-Rally 3. This was followed by the purchase in Shiny Entertainment which was developing Enter the Matrix game for the upcoming Matrix movie.These acquisitions in the past several years had an impact on IESA's financial position. The company debt had risen from $55 million in 1999 to $493 million in 2002 and it posted a net loss of $67 million in this financial year.The image below charts the history of how the original Atari, Inc. became incorporated into Infogrames and later became the new Atari SA.History of Atari",

They develop games mainly for the PC but have also released games on other platforms such as Super NES, Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis and Xbox.In December, 2005, Funcom became the first game developer to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.In March, 2007, Funcom stopped releasing games on CD and DVD, and started to use digital distribution completely. This was done because of financial losses due to piracy of their games.On August 21, 2008, Funcom laid off half of its Customer Service department located in Durham, North Carolina. In November of the same year it was reported that Funcom fired an additional 70% of their US staff.In September of 2008, one of the founders and game director of Age of Conan, Gaute Godager, left Funcom because he was dissatisfied with parts of Age of Conan.In February of 2009 Funcom reported financial losses of approximately $23 million in Q4 of 2008, and the unsuccessful launch of Age of Conan was largely to blame. An analyst at DnB NOR, estimated that around 100,000 people were playing the game immediately after launch. This was far below what Funcom had expected.On September 1, 2009, Funcom announced that they were opening a new studio in Montreal, Canada. The new studio is currently working on their latest MMO, The Secret World, and was also the developer of the Age of Conan expansion, Rise of the Godslayer. Shortly after the announcement of the new studio Funcom reduced their staff by 20%.In August 2010 Funcom's financial situation was starting to improve. Trond Arne Aas said that \"Age Of Conan is generating cash for us and these money are supporting the development of new projects. We will continue to invest in Age Of Conan as the game can continue to support other projects under development.\" Funcom is planning on releasing Age of Conan in Asia, and expects this to generate additional revenue to support the game.In August of 2012 Funcom announced the layoff of half of its employees due to the lackluster performance of The Secret World. Funcom blames a poor Metacritic score and the launch of Diablo 3 for The Secret World's unsuccessful launch.Funcom is the publisher of Bloodline Champions, a free-to-play PvP arena game, developed by Swedish developer Stunlock Studios.",

Interplay Entertainment Corp's full birthname in 1983 was Interplay Productions, Inc., based in southern California. In the early 80s, Interplay created a name for itself primarily due to The Bard's Tale franchise. Later stand-alone releases found equally high success and critical acclaim and Interplay's turnout in until 1993 included games such as Battle Chess, Wasteland, Star Trek 25th Anniversary, Star Trek Judgment Rites as well as an ever-growing array of conversions and ports for The Bard's Tale games. As a publisher, Interplay had a fruitful collaboration with French game studio Delphine Software, of whom Interplay published games such as Future Wars, Out of This World and Cruise for a Corpse.Interplay went on to create and publish more successful original and licensed game franchises, which included many Star Trek games of many different genres as well as the classic Baldur's Gate franchise. Furthermore, Interplay's original franchises include the Fallout series and Freespace.Interplay faced growing financial troubles and limited success as the new millennium went on and despite critical acclaim, many of their published games, such as Giants: Citizen Kabuto, Sacrifice and Freespace 2 did not sell too well. Interplay's own ambitions as game developer decreased dramatically and their later years (from 2001 onwards) were primarily dedicated to the extension and maintenance of the Fallout franchise.Titus Interactive gained the majority control of Interplay in 2001 which resulted in Brian Fargo leaving Interplay for good, who founded new company InXile Entertainment in 2003. InXile acquired the rights to Wasteland and ever since rumors have been circulating related to a re-birth and continuation of the franchise that inspired Fallout in the first place. However, Titus Interactive struggled with financial difficulties as well and Interplay was briefly shut down in 2004 and filed for bankruptcy in 2005.Interplay re-injected financial flexibility and substance into itself by selling the Fallout IP to Bethesda Softworks in 2007.Recently, Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay Entertainment and asked them to stop selling the Fallout trilogy and to cease work and send any work completed on the upcoming Fallout MMO, codenamed \"Project V13\".The court ruled in Interplay's favor and allowed them the permission to continue selling the Fallout trilogy and to continue development on the \"Project V13\" MMO.On January 1, 2012, it was announced that the Fallout MMO has been cancelled as part of a legal settlement between Zenimax and Interplay. Interplay will also relinquish the remaining rights to the Fallout brand in December of 2013.",

    "description": "Harmonix was founded in 1995 by Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy. They began the company on the idea that everyone should be able to experience the joy of performing music, even those who may have trouble learning a traditional instrument. They had moderate success with their first few titles, but really hit it big with the introduction of Guitar Hero, which eventually evolved into the Rock Band franchise.On February 7th, 2011, Harmonix announced layoffs intended to bring the studio \"into alignment with our current product development plans.\" Approximately 12-15% of the 240 employees were laid off.FreQuency was released on November 20th, 2001 and was Harmonix's first game on the Playstation 2 console. The gameplay of FreQuency revolved around the player guiding a virtual avatar known as FreQ down a note highway in the shape of an octagonal tunnel. There would be musical tracks lining the walls of this tunnel. On these tracks were notes that if the player hit the corresponding key of on their Playstation 2 controller would emit a sound which would combine to form the track. If the player managed to correctly do this for up to two bars of the track, the game would tell the player the track had been captured. The game featured 27 tracks from various artists including some from in-house musician and musical director Kasson Crooker and his band Freezepop who have gone on to be featured in other Harmonix games. The game gave Harmonix critical acclaim and sold enough copies to warrant a sequel. The sequel, Amplitude, was released on March 24th, 2003.Released on the back of FreQuency's success, Amplitude was released exclusively to the Playstation 2 in March 2003 a year and a half after FreQuency. Using FreQuency's successful formula it added new features and better graphics to make what many believe to be a legitimate update from FreQuency. It contained 26 songs which was actually 1 less than its predecessor. A rare occurrence in the music game genre nowadays as every game tries to add more songs than the one before. It included a remix mode in a similar style to the one featured in FreQuency giving the player the ability to customize songs to their own liking. The game was also well received by the gaming press getting high scores on websites such as Gamespot and IGN. The sucess of both Amplitude and FreQuency gave Harmonix the chance to team up with publisher Red Octane to create the Guitar Hero series.The Guitar Hero franchise first appeared on store shelves in 2005 with the release of the first game in the series, Guitar Hero for the Playstation 2. Guitar Hero took the ideas showed in FreQuency and Amplitude of a note highway, but reduced the number of tracks to just one and added the use of a guitar shaped controller that came bundled with the game. This controller had 5 colored buttons on the guitar in place of frets which acted like the buttons on a PlayStation 2 controller and a strum bar which was used like strings and that had to be strummed every time a note was played. Guitar Hero featured 47 songs on the disc. Most of which were cover versions of rock songs. Guitar Hero sold well. Eventually selling 1.53 million copies and making $45 million dollars. Its success led to the cultural phenomenon that Guitar Hero is today, as well as spawning many sequels. Sequels like Guitar Hero 3, which made $1 billion dollars being the first video game to ever do so. When their contract with Red Octane ended in 2006 they were purchased by Viacom, the parent company of MTV Games, as well as the MTV network channels, who would go on to publish Harmonix's future titles under their own MTV Games label with distribution & marketing being handled by EA. Red Octane was purchased by Activision at about the same time that Harmonix was sold to Viacom thereby severing all ties between the two companies. The Guitar Hero series was handed off to Activision subsidiary studio Neversoft for future development. Harmonix would go on to start an all new franchise that has arguably surpassed anything that has come before it in the music / rhythm category, Rock Band.Upon being acquired by MTV games they began work on a new muic game title known as Rock Band, which would take the primary gameplay from Guitar Hero and add two extra instruments to the game, a 4 pad drum kit and a microphone to give the full band feel. Released on November 20th, 2007 (the same day 6 years earlier that FreQuency was released) it was like its now rival creation Guitar Hero and had commercial and critical success selling over 4 million units and creating $600 million dollars in revenue. One of the key aspects of its success was its Music Store which was a feature on the menu of the game that took you to an iTunes like interface where you could purchase additional songs in either single form, a track pack or a whole album. This enabled some people to instead of having a setlist of 58 songs to grow their library into the hundreds. On September 14th, 2008, Rock Band 2 was released. The game sold more than 1.7 million copies before the end of the year. As of November 25th, 2009 there were over 1,000 songs available for download in the Rock Band Store. Harmonix also released two band-specific games, The Beatles: Rock Band and Green Day: Rock Band. They also released Lego: Rock Band, a version of the game that featured more kid-friendly music. On October 26th 2010, Harmonix released Rock Band 3, which took the tried and true Rock Band formula and added support for a keyboard peripheral. As of February 2011, there are over 2,500 different songs available to play in Rock Band, with new tracks still being added every week.Harmonix moved on from the Rock Band franchise to develop a dancing game series for the Xbox 360, for use only with the Kinect peripheral. The game is able to scan your body and register the dance moves you are performing. The first game in the series was revealed at E3 2010 during the Microsoft press conference, and was released on November 4th, 2010 alongside the launch of the Kinect. ",

On April 22, 2009, Eidos became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square Enix.Following the business deal, games developed by the company will still carry the Eidos name but games published by the company will carry the new Square Enix Europe label.The most successful franchises to come out of the company have been the Tomb Raider and Hitman series of games. Both series have received generally positive reviews, and the original Tomb Raider is revered as a classic game of the original Playstation's life cycle. The game was remade and released in 2007 to positive reviews. In the early 2000's, the games spawned two films, both of which were generally well-received. Many regard the Tomb Raider films as the better of a long line of terrible game-to-movie adaptations.Much like Tomb Raider before it, the Hitman franchise has been popular with critics and also spawned a feature film. The original Hitman, entitled Hitman: Codename 47 was released in the year 2000, and was dismissed by both gamers and critics due to technical glitches and an underwhelming performance. The sequel, dubbed Hitman 2: Silent Assassin was well received and marked the first successful entry into the series. There were two more sequels after that, Hitman: Contracts, and Hitman: Blood Money, both of which were large successes and well received. A film version of the game was released in theatres in the fall of 2007, starring former Deadwood star Timothy Olyphant. The film was poorly received by critics and had a relatively poor showing at the box office, and eventually fell off the radar.While many publishers have been implicated in meddling with the press to obtain good review scores and the possible sales boost that can come from that, Eidos in particular has received much criticism over the years for their interference with the critical process. Two of their more publicized controversies are described below.\"Did you happen to see that our readers can skin the entire site with Kane, Lynch or with Kane AND Lynch together? Did you see how they can cut their own riveting Kane & Lynch trailers?\"Perhaps their most infamous review controversy, in November 2007, Eidos was implicated in being involved in the firing of Jeff Gerstmann, former Editorial Director of CNET's Gamespot. Gerstmann gave Eidos' major release for that fall, IO Interactive's Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, a 6.0 out of 10. Shortly following, he was let go from his Gamespot position. Insider sources claimed that Gerstmann had been fired for giving the game a low score after Eidos complained to CNET; these claims were corroborated by a massive advertising campaign Eidos had been running with Gamespot--a campaign that skinned the front page of the website with Kane and Lynch imagery and allowed users to edit their own trailers--that promptly ended following the publishing of the review, the text of the review being edited and the video review for the game being pulled from the site shortly after Gerstmann's departure, and the mass exodus of other key staff members in the months following. It was eventually revealed that Eidos had indeed complained to CNET and threatened to pull advertising, but ultimately backed down and had no direct involvement in Gerstmann's firing. Eidos' complaint was one of a handful of complaints from several games publishers over lower-than-average scores for some games during Q4 of 2007; the complaint from Eidos was ultimately the straw that broke the camel's back that led to the CNET administration, whom had seen huge turnover at the time and was generally inexperienced with running a gaming website, losing confidence in Gerstmann and deciding to distance themselves from his editorial direction.A year after being accused of being one of the primary forces behind Jeff Gerstmann's dismissal, Eidos was again accused of using advertising dollars to buy favorable coverage, this time with British-based Future Publishing. In the week leading up to the game's release, GamesRadar, Future's flagship online gaming portal, began a campaign that saw a Tomb Raider-related article published every day in honor of Tomb Raider Underworld, culminating in the website changing its name to \"Tomb Radar\" for a day. Future's James Binn lauded the campaign, stating:“Tomb Raider: Underworld is a great game, well worth the 9/10 scores it is picking up across gaming websites and magazines. Getting the message out there on launch day is essential in the games market and this takeover gives Eidos unprecedented cut through.”On the heels of the Tomb Radar name change, Gamespot UK's Guy Cooker posted to his Twitter that Eidos had asked any publication scoring the game lower than an 8.0 to hold the review until the following Monday. Commenting on the scandal, a representative from Eidos' PR firm stated (in a statement that was later retracted):“We’re trying to get the Metacritic rating to be high, and the brand manager in the US that’s handling all of Tomb Raider has asked that we just manage the scores before the game is out, really, just to ensure that we don’t put people off buying the game, basically.”Ironically, PC Gamer UK--a fellow Future publication whose Tomb Raider: Underworld review was repurposed for Games Radar--thought slightly less of the game than the \"across the board\" 9/10 scores Binn had noted, scoring it an 86%. However, when they republishing the review for their site, GamesRadar changed the score to a 9 in accordance with their ten-point scale.Amusingly, Future did not buy domain rights for tombradar.com during the campaign. The domain was purchased by an anonymous third-party, who used the site to lambast the GamesRadar campaign using many of the above quotes. The site has since been taken down.In February 2009, word came out that Square Enix Holdings Co. Ltd. had come to an agreement to purchase the financially struggling Eidos for roughly $120 million. Throughout the remainder of February and March, support was gained by many shareholders, including Warner Bros., for the purchase.On March 30, 2009, at an emergency meeting of shareholders, the terms set forth by Square Enix were agreed upon by an overwhelming majority.On April 21st, Eidos stock was delisted, and on the following day, Eidos became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square Enix Holdings Co. Ltd. Square Enix president Yoichi Wada has stated that Eidos will continue to run as a separate entity under the Square Enix banner, much the same way that Taito is.As of July 7, 2009, the use of the Eidos name for titles published by the company was discontinued, and subsequent Eidos-developed games have been published under the Square Enix label. Eidos CEO Phil Rogers was appointed the head of the newly reformed Square Enix Europe, and placed in charge of publishing all of Eidos and Square Enix titles in Europe.The Eidos name has lived on with the internal studios that were using the moniker at the time of Eidos' merger with Square Enix, such as with Deus Ex: Human Revolution developers Eidos Montréal.",

The company's name was primarily chosen because it appeared alphabetically higher than Activision, a strategy that was used by Activision themselves and several others including Accolade and Acclaim when developing for Atari.The company's games met with a fair amount of success in the late 80s and early 90s but experienced a sharp drop in overall quality which resulted in negative reviews and poor sales. Under growing financial pressure, management decided to shut Absolute down in 1995. A new company called SkyWorks Technologies was founded by several of the original Absolute staff before the closure and continues to operate successfully to this day.",

    "description": "Cauldron was founded in 1996 in Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak Republic, where it resides today. They employ approximately 60 people at present, and were the first Slovakian or Czech game developers to successfully sell a product outside the two countries.The first game from their offices was \"Quadrax\". Finished in 1996, this game was originally made for the ZX Spectrum, but promptly ported to PC. It is a two dimensional puzzle game that consists of 100 levels which require the user to utilize the the ability to switch control between two on-screen characters in order to navigate the puzzle. It is supposedly still the most popular puzzle game in that region.In 1997, the Czech version of \"Spellcross\" was finished. However, it was improved and edited a year later for it's English release. The game, as well as it's \"mist\" engine was welcomed with positive reviews. The user plays the role of a commander for the fictional faction, \"The Alliance\", a group using modern military might to fight creatures that utilize magic. The game is divided into two parts; the first is strategic, where the player makes large scale troop movement decisions and manages resources and finances, and the second is tactical, where the player uses military units in turn based combat. Spellcross was the first game from either Slovakia or the Czech republic to be sold outside those countries. It is also supposedly still very popular in those countries.Cauldron released another turn-based strategy game in 2000 called \"Battle Isle: The Andosia War\".In 2001, Cauldron began work on one of their best known efforts, the first person shooter, \"Chaser\". The user assumes the role of \"John Chaser\" on a quest through Earth and Mars to regain his memory. Chaser was released in 2003 to great critical acclaim. It's best known for it's visuals and the ability to host multiplayer matches of up to 128 players in such classic modes as \"Capture the Flag\" and \"Deathmatch\". It used Cauldron's new in-house \"CloakNT\" engine, which every Cauldron FPS to date uses. Chaser was also their most successful effort in North America.In 2004 they released \"Conan\", based on Robert E. Howard's \"Conan: The Barbarian\". This was Cauldron's first true multiplatform game.In 2005, \"Knights of the Temple II\" was finished. It was an open world 3rd person action adventure game with interactive dialogue, alternate endings and multiplayer.Cauldron also finished \"Gene Troopers\" in 2005. It is a FPS set in the future where genetic material is now an important strategic resource, and a faction called \"the Gene Troopers\" seeks to collect more and more genetic material to further their super soldier creation program.In 2006 Cauldron released \"Civil War: A Nation Divided\". This game reenacts 12 different battles from the American civil war.In 2007 Cauldron released \"Battle for the Pacific\", which has the player fighting on the front lines in the most crucial battles of the pacific front of WWII.Also released in 2007 was the third installment in the Soldier of Fortune series, \"Soldier of Fortune: Payback\". While visually proficient, the game was critically panned. It's faults lied largely in the short development time, a supposed result of the lack of funding on Activision's part.In 2008, Cauldron released both \"Civil War: Secret Missions\" and \"Secret Service\". Secret Missions is a fallow up to their previous Civil War game, which has you engage in real historical missions to sabotage either side of the conflict. Secret Service is a game in which the user assumes the role of a secret service agent, who is tasked with protecting political figures and other high value assets, including the United States president.",

    "description": " Delphine Software International (often referred under the acronym DSI) was established in 1988 in Paris, France (they would relocated to Saint-Ouen in 2001) as a subsidiary of Delphine Group.  The co-directors of the company were Paul de Senneville and Paul Cuisset, who was also the lead designer on most of their projects.  The company had some early hits such as Out of This World (also known as Another World) , Flashback and had moderate successes throughout the 1990s.  In 1993, they also created a subsidary studio known as Adeline Software International that was based in Lyon, France.In 2002, parent company Delphine Group spun off Delphine Software International (who retained Adeline Software International as a subsidiary) after continued financial difficulties.  It was hoped that they would be able to stage a turnaround by operating independently.  This was unfortunately not to be and in February 2003, the company was sold to Doki Denki Studio who themselves went into liquidation in 2004, closing down all three branches. Paul Cuisset has since moved on to form a new studio called VectorCell which he co-owns with fellow French game developers Lexis Numérique.",

    "description": "Sensible Software was founded by two wannabe rock stars, Jon Hare and Chris Yate. Having had limited success under numerous band incarnations such as Hamsterfish, Dark Globe and Touchstone, rock's loss was the games industry's gain as Sensible Software would go on to make some of the most iconic and memorable games of the eighties and nineties.Between them the duo covered the core skills needed to mould a fledgling games company. Jon, a talented artist, and Chris, a skilled programmer, decided to pursue their interest in videogames, and found employment with LT Software.During a successful but short period at LT Software Jon and Chris were credited with producing two of the ZX Spectrums most impressive games Twister and Sordov the Sorcerer.Using the skills gained from their nine-month stay at LT, the pair broke away and formed their own company. Sensible Software was born.front coverThe two-man team immediately set to work on Parallax for the Commodore 64, which won them a £1000 deal with Ocean Publishing, and became Sensible’s first success.Sensible Software’s first critically acclaimed game came in the infancy of the company; Wizball was proclaimed to be “Game of the Decade” (1980’s) by Zzap64 magazine.WizballThe young software house based in Chelmsford, Essex, U.K. was establishing a reputation for high quality software and Wizball was just the tip of the iceberg.Following on from the success of Wizball Sensible Software released Shoot-Em Up Construction Kit (S.E.U.C.K.), which allowed players with no knowledge of game creation the chance to generate their own content within hours.Well-known game music composer Martin Galway joined Hare and Yate at Sensible, and that summer, the three-man company released Microprose Soccer, which was hailed as the sport’s finest simulation to date. The sport theme continued with International 3D Tennis, one of their final projects for the C64.Jon and Chris now found themselves leading a profitable, reputable company. It was a meteoric rise since joining LT Software as college-dropouts, but their success hadn’t peaked yet.Early in 1990 Martin Galway left to join fledgling software house Origin in the United States, but his departure didn’t slow the growth of Sensible Software. Brimming with confidence and with an established reputation the company migrated from the 8-bit era to the new, more powerful Amiga and Atari ST. The increase in processing power also brought about a change in direction for Sensible Software with two of their most original products; Mega-Lo-Mania and Wizkid. The former was a well-received simulation of a God’s struggle for dominance, and the latter was a platformer which continued the narrative of their earlier hit, Wizball.Xbox live versonSensible Soccer marked the return to sports for the company and was released to a roar of critical acclaim. It was an instant classic, and spent almost the entire year on top of the games chart.The Controversial Title ScreenWith numerous updates and ports of Sensible Soccer selling in huge numbers, the company next produced the social commentary Cannon Fodder, which was greeted with critical acclaim, but was also accompanied by controversy centred on the poppy-adorned game box. Detractors also claimed the game glorified warfare, when in truth it was a satire of those that engaged in such conflict. Despite such negative coverage, the game was a success; but it would be the company's last.Sensible’s new IP’s beyond this point, such as the the disappointing Sensible Golf, never got anywhere near the heights of their golden period between 1987 and 1995 as the company expanded in numbers and grappled with 3D for the first time. They also explored new concepts such as the game Sex ‘n’ Drugs ‘n’ Rock ‘n’ Roll (originally a joke game idea called \"Drugged out Hippy\" invented by Chris and Jon during their rock days.) This game was signed up by Warner Interactive for a 7 figure sum in 1995 but support for the project was pulled due to the game’s controversial themes, coding problems and a change of control when Warner was sold to GT Software.At this point, Sensible’s owners were looking for a way to bow out gracefully, and their wish was granted when veteran UK publisher Codemasters bought them out in 1999. Jon Hare has maintained a close working relationship with Codemasters ever since, designing many games for them including updates of Sensible Soccer for the PlayStation, Cannon Fodder for the Gameboy Color, and a recently updated Sensible World of Soccer for Xbox Live Arcade.",

Desperados, set in the wild west, which spawned a sequel, as well as Robin Hood : The Legend of Sherwood, which was less successful than Desperados but received critical acclaim for technical merits, such as the cut scenes and the graphics engine. Their two subsequent releases flopped on the market (Chicago 1930 and Smoking Guns) and after releasing the moderately successful, if eagerly anticipated, sequel to Desperados, Spellbound was dropped by their publishers ( ATARI) and they had to find new publishing deals.

    "description": "HAL Laboratory, Inc. is a Japanese second party development studio subsidiary of Nintendo, based in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The company has a very close working relationship with the Nintendo EAD division and has collaborated with them extensively on many games across several generations of Nintendo platforms including the Super Smash Bros. series. HAL laboratory games are popularly praised for their simple intuitive controls and addictive play.Founded on February 21, 1980 in Tokyo, Japan, HAL Laboratory has created games for many consoles and computers, including the Commodore 64, MSX, NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Wii, Nintendo DS and 3DS. Their name is a reference to the HAL 9000 computer in from the famous science fiction novel (and film) 2001: A Space Odyssey.Satoru Iwata, former president of Nintendo and ex-HAL employeeThe company was originally started by a department store manager and a group of enthusiast employees, now-famous industry icons Satoru Iwata and Masahito Tanimura among them. As Iwata recalls in an interview, \"We became friends, formed a club, and soon rented an apartment in the Akihabara district of Tokyo where we began designing our own games. We worked until midnight or later every night, and that group of friends is what became the company known as HAL today.\" It was this enthusiast passion that allowed HAL to grow from a basement club to the bastion of quality family gaming that it is today.Although the company was made up of hardcore enthusiasts, it wasn't video games that HAL first developed. Instead, they worked on a few peripherals before getting to their real dream of developing games. They first made a scanner and a trackball for the MSX system. Despite the fact that these weren't actually games, the peripherals proved successful and HAL was quickly propelled into the meat of game development, with their first official release being Eggerland for the MSX in 1985. This would serve as the basis for their Lolo games.The company first rose to prominence with Western audiences in 1989 with the release of its surprise hit Lolo games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Lolo series would serve as an aesthetic and game design template for future HAL games, the most notable of these being their signature Kirby franchise which was created immediately after the Lolo games had their run. The Kirby character has become one of Nintendo's best known mascots and has appeared in over twenty-five games as of 2011.Return to Dreamland is the latest in HAL's hugely successful Kirby franchiseBefore they could develop Kirby, though, HAL had to prove themselves to Nintendo. Not always a subsidiary of Nintendo's, HAL took contracts from numerous different companies and worked on many different platforms at the start of their life cycle. When they began to hear rumors that Nintendo was hard at work developing a home console that would be capable of stunning new graphics (this console would turn out to be the NES, or Famicom in Japan) they rushed to secure a contract to develop for the system. Instead of allowing them to do their own original game, however, Nintendo hired them to fix one of theirs that had fallen far behind schedule. Thus was NES Pinball born. After the surprise success of this once-broken game, HAL was allowed much more creative freedom, and went on to create both the Kirby and Earthbound series, both of which received massive critical acclaim over their life cycles.Since then the studio has found even greater fame creating and developing Nintendo's extremely popular Super Smash Bros series, a few games of the world famous Pokemon series and the cult hit Mother series (known in America as Earthbound). In 2011 HAL released their first augmented reality game, Face Raiders, for the Nintendo 3DS.HAL Laboratory is also notable for its talent. Satoru Iwata, former president of Nintendo, used to be the president of HAL Laboratory. Before founding Sora, Ltd., Masahiro Sakurai (creator of Kirby and Super Smash Bros.) worked at HAL Laboratory.HAL Laboratories took on its name from the AI in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is speculated that they chose the name because the film, which emphasizes the cold and calculating nature of technology, inspired them to make their company the warm, approachable face of video game technology that they are today. Although mere speculation, titles such as Kirby's Epic Yarn go a long way towards validating this policy.Further evidence of this is shown in their work mantras. Much like Valve and id, HAL takes a \"when it's done\" approach to releasing their games, emphasizing within the company the full completion of a product before it is released to store shelves.HAL also encourages its employees to play games together socially as a way of bringing the team together. In addition to allowing team members to bond with one another, this also keeps HAL abreast of all the current trends in game design, ensuring that their products remain competitive even in such a crowded market. For HAL, it is this mixture of developing and playing that leads to such magical success. It is important to maintain and nurture employee's passion for the industry that they inhabit, and for HAL, this method has been a success.HAL Laboratory, Inc was situated within Pokémon Blue and Red in Celadon city as an easter egg. Collect all 150 Pokémon and you gain a special prize.Despite having no new releases since the early 90's, The Lolo characters often make cameos in the Kirby games.In their early part of their HAL Laboratory was often attributed inconsistently in their titles. They were credited in their games as HAL Laboratory, HAL America and HALKEN on varying releases until the mid 1990'sIn the ZombiU edition of \"Iwata Asks,\" Iwata states that \"HAL was named as such because each letter put us one step ahead of IBM.\"",

    "description": "Bethesda Softworks is a development studio located in Rockville, Maryland. Bethesda specializes in role-playing games, and is considered by many to be one of the leading Western RPG developers along with Bioware. Bethesda has released many well-received games like Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 3. Bethesda bought the license to create Fallout games from Interplay in 2004 for one-million USD in cash. They then announced that they were working on their first installment in the Fallout franchise in 2007. Other licenses owned by Bethesda include the license for non-MMO Star Trek games. Bethesda is currently owned by ZeniMax Media Inc. who has provided Bethesda with enough funds to publish Fallout 3 on its own, and will likely be publishing its own games from here on out.Bethesda Team (Skyrim)Bethesda Softworks was founded in 1985 by Christopher Weaver in Bethesda, Maryland. The company relocated to its current location of Rockville, Maryland in 1990. Bethesda's first title was a sports simulation game called Gridiron!, released in 1986. From 1986 to 1992 the company developed a number of games, including several Terminator titles and many sports simulator games. In 1993 Bethesda released the first game in what is likely its most recognizable franchise, The Elder Scrolls: Arena. Arena is a first person action RPG that put a lot of focus on side quests and featured an open ended world called, Tamriel. Company founder Christopher Weaver is recognized as the principal force behind the creation of the game. The Elder Scrolls: Arena was developed for the computer and released via CD-ROM, and Floppy disc. Bethesda released its second title in The Elder Scrolls series in 1996, called The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, for the computer.In 1999, Bethesda Softworks was acquired by ZeniMax Media Inc., a company founded by Bethesda Softworks founder, Christopher Weaver and current ZeniMax Media Inc. CEO, Robert A. Altman. From 1999 to 2001, Bethesda developed and published mainly sports and racing titles like, NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing, Skip Barber Racing, PBA Bowling 2001, IHRA Motorsports, as well as an adventure game, Sea Dogs, and an action game, Echelon. In 2002, Bethesda released the third title in The Elder Scrolls series, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, for Windows PC and Xbox. The game was, at the time, one of Bethesda's most successful titles, selling over four million copies and winning numerous awards. Two expansion packs were released for the game, The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal in 2002, and The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon in 2003. In 2006, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was released (published by 2K Games), receiving the best reviews, in average, of any The Elder Scrolls games, and selling over three million copies as of January 18, 2007. Bethesda developed and published its latest title, Fallout 3.In 2004, Bethesda Softworks bought the rights to the Fallout IP from Interplay Entertainment, and started development on Fallout 3 the same year. The Executive Producer for the game was Todd Howard, who was involved, in different capacities, in all of the principal titles of The Elder Scroll series, and was Project Lead for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and executive producer for the development of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Fallout 3 was released, in North America on October 28, 2008, for the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. The game has become Bethesda's best selling game to date, shipping 4.7 million copies of the game internationally, for the first week, and producing a profit of $300 million. In 2009, the company released a staggering five pieces of Fallout 3 DLC (Downloadable Content) for the Xbox 360, PS3 and the PC. At QuakeCon 2010 Todd Howard revealed that Bethesda is currently working on two projects. The first was revealed to be The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on December 11, 2010 at the Spike VGAs with a projected release date of November 11, 2011. The second game has yet to be revealed, but is in preproduction.The Bethesda Softworks headquarters--located in Rockville, Maryland--is quite an extensive building. Video game publication Game Informer took a trip to the headquarters to shoot a behind the scene video for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Todd Howard revealed the large exercise room (where several members of the team go to practice martial arts) as well as large kitchen where the staff is served breakfast, lunch, and even dinner each day.Bethblog.com is an unofficial blog run by Bethesda's employees. It's not the mouthpiece for ZeniMax but the blog covers all of Bethesda's latest video games with podcasts that regularly feature senior figures like John Carmack & Todd Howard.",

Internal wranglings within Namco would lead to the sale of Atari games to Hide Nakajima, general manager of Atari Japan, a company with strong ties to Atari Inc and to employees within the company.In 1993 Time-Warner (formerly Warner Communications and Time-Life) once again bought a controlling interest in Atari Games and made it a subsidiary of its newly formed Time Warner Interactive division. In 1996 Atari Games was once again sold, this time to Midway and with the purchase of Atari Corporation by Hasbro Interactive, Midway decided to rename Atari Games to Midway Games West to avoid confusion between the two brands.In 2003 Midway games closed Midway Games West as in continued to loose money in its Arcade division and the Atari Games brand cease to exit. Things didn't look good for Midway Games either with its publishing and development business loosing money, claimed of Chapter 11 bankruptcy filed in February 2009. Majority of Midway Games asset's were later being purchased by Warner Bros.",

    "description": "The ASCII Corporation were a Japanese company that was formed in 1977, in a co-operative merger with the NEC company. This co-operative agreement was in order to create a Japanese home computer system, called the MSX. The ASCII Corporation was founded by Kazuhiko Nishi.During the early years of the ASCII Corporation's existence, the group focused on developing the MSX and different content for it. It also formed a joint venture with Microsoft in 1979, and represented Microsoft in Japan until 1986 when it went public and opened its own Japanese office.However, during the 1980s when the videogame market seemed to collapse, the group decided to focus on publishing Japanese games for the popular consoles of the time - the most notable of these being the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. The company reported success in this market, and chose to form an American branch of their company. This branch was formed in 1991, and became known as ASCII Entertainment.Over time the market once held by ASCII Corporation shrunk considerably, and the company grew weaker in its market over time. In a complete change, the market possessed by ASCII Entertainment (their US brand) grew considerably. Due to this success, another brand was formed by the ASCII Corporation. This company was known as ASCII Game Entertainment Technology, and was commonly abbreviated to Agetec. After just over a year, Agetec was sold off and managed to survive thanks to different company relationships.During March 2002, ASCII chose to cease all game-based operations, and to return to their original field of work: computer systems. ASCII also had a prestigious computer magazine, called ASCII Magazine. The rest of the company was eventually disposed of, for lack of a better term, as 'Media Leaves Inc.'. In 2004, ASCII and all of its subsidaries were purchased by Kadokawa Holdings. This movement by Kadokawa made them the largest distributor of games, and gaming media, in the entire Japanese market.",

APX entries were also elligible for sizable cash prizes, as judged for quality.  Some of the titles, such as Eastern Front (1941) were later released as full Atari titles due to their quality and popularity.At the time APX was instituted, there was a still a rise in computer popularity, but the gaming bust was only a few months ahead.  Getaway! is by some regarded as the last notable title for APX, before the downturn began.",

    "description": "Naughty Dog LogoNaughty Dog, Inc is a game studio based in Santa Monica, CA. The studio was founded in 1986 by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin whose first game was Ski Crazed for the Apple II. However, the studio have since become famous for their work on Sony's PlayStation hardware, with their series; Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, and Uncharted. Due to their success on the systems in 2001 Naughty Dog was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment.Naughty Dog has released a total of 14 games. The game list, in chronological order, is as follows:Keef the Thief (1989)Rings of Power (1991)Way of the Warrior (1994)Crash Bandicoot (1996)Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back (1997)Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped (1998)Crash Team Racing (1999)Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy (2001)Jak II (2003)Jak 3 (2004)Jak X: Combat Racing (2005)Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (2007)Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009)Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011)The Last of Us (2013)Crash BandicootNaughty Dog is an American video game development company founded in 1986 by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin. When the company was first established they were known as JAM and their first official game was Ski Crazed for the Apple II which was made when Andy and Jason were only 16. By the Nineties the company had changed their name to Naughty Dog and progressed to creating Way of the Warrior for the 3DO. Arguably their most renowned property, the Crash Bandicoot series, came about when Sonic The Hedgehog 2 producer Mark Cerny suggested the company focus on a character based platform game for the newly revealed Playstation console. The Crash series, consisting of 4 games went on to sell over 22 million copies combined on the Playstation, making Naughty Dog the most successful developer in the US for that generation.Jak and DaxterWith the next Playstation console Naughty Dog decided to start afresh with a new series, Jak & Daxter, and to use the increased power of the console to give the game a larger, open world scope and a greater degree of fidelity and detail. Almost a year before completion of the first Jak & Daxter game, in January 2001 it was announced that Naughty Dog was becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony. As with the Crash series Naughty Dog released 4 games in the main series on the PS2 (as well as a Daxter only spin off on the PSP) and each sold well and were generally received positively by gamers. Unlike Crash however, it has been strongly hinted that we will see Jak & Daxter return on the current generation of consoles, namely the PS3. In 2004, co-founder Jason Rubin left the company to focus on a comic book project.Nathan DrakeWith the bump up in technology again afforded by the new generation of consoles Naughty Dog decided to take another step forward graphically, this time creating a series based in the real world. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune debuted at E3 2006 and was initially criticized for looking similar to the Tomb Raider series. When the game was released it was received positively by critics and eventually sold over 2 million copies. The sequel Uncharted 2: Among Thieves was released in 2009 and received universal praise. The development team at Naughty Dog quickly went into working off their success from Uncharted 2 and refine it with more polish and technology. In the fall of 2011, they released Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception.The Last of Us (2012)After the release of the third in the Uncharted series, Naughty Dog had put the story of Nathan Drake on hold to begin a game called The Last of Us. The trailer was debuted at the 2011 SPIKE TV Video Game Awards. The game features the characters Joel and Ellie travelling across a post-apocalyptic United States. The game was released in June 2013 to universal acclaim. A movie adaptation is currently in the works. Naughty Dog has a strong working relationship with developer Insomniac Games, originating from their history of working in the same building on the Universal Studios backlot. Even their output shares a close resemblance, Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot, Ratchet & Clank and Jak & Daxter, even the move to realism taken with Resistance and Uncharted. Indeed the developers have stated that they are able to share technology and development knowledge to mutually improve the user experience. One important distinction is that while Naughty Dog is owned by Sony, Insomniac Games are fully independent but choose to develop only on the Sony platforms. Naughty Dog is home to a Sony World Wide Studios central technology group called the ICE Team. Created by Mark Cerny, the ICE team assists developers of PlayStation 3 titles who are experiencing difficulties with developing for the PS3's hardware. Developers can send pieces of their game to the ICE Team, who will diagnose their problems and propose recommendations and solutions to implement in their games.",

    "description": "Techland began as a Polish distributor in 1991, originally translating and dealing educational software. Games were produced a few years later, when the company stared to developed their own products, and publish those made by other developers. Speedway Manager was the first game made by the internal studio, which consisted of only one person at the time. Without much success, the company continued to produce games, mostly mediocre family software.The year 2000 was a breakthrough for Techland, marked by the release of Crime Cities, a highly praised action game set in the future. It was also their first game to be released outside Poland. Then, in 2003, Techland released Chrome - a futuristic shooter made with their own game-engine, entitled Chrome Engine. This engine became a base for almost all future games made by the Polish company.A period of stagnation was once again disrupted in 2006, with Call of Juarez. Not only was it the first game ever to use DirectX 10, but it was also the first Polish game to be released for Xbox 360. 1.5 million copies of the games were sold, and this huge intake of money allowed Techland to hire more developers. In the following years, the company also started a copy of well-known aggregates, called BazaRecenzji. This project was aimed at Polish users, but the website was eventually closed in 2011.In 2009, Techland released a prequel to Call of Juarez, entitled Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood. It was the first Polish title to be released simultaneously for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. However, Techland was already thinking about something bigger - Dead Island. This games was originally set to debut in 2008, but was delayed multiple times. Development was taking more and more resources, and games such as Chrome 2 and Warhound were suspended. Finally, in September 2011 Dead Island was released, followed by a big marketing campaign with the infamously misleading trailer made by Axis Productions. Despite many bugs, the game was well received and eventually shipped 4 million copies.",

    "description": "John SmedleySOE's history reaches as far back as 1995, though the brand of \"Sony Online Entertainment\" was born in mid 2000. In the mid 90's, when Sony stormed the gaming world with the original PlayStation, they formed a studio in San Diego called Sony Interactive Studios America. This studio was tasked with developing a PC role-playing game helmed by John Smedley. Development on this new project began in March 1996 with Brad McQuaid as lead programmer and designer.In November 1997, the studio released their first title, Tanarus, an online tank battle game from a first-person perspective. Development on their ambitious online RPG continued concurrently. In April 1998, Sony merged several studios (SISA, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Sony Online Ventures) and renamed the group 989 Studios. But by the end of the year, 989 Studios focus was more on creating games for the booming PlayStation console, not PC games that had been SISA's primary forte. So, the part of the studio that continued work on their massively multiplayer online role-playing game renamed themselves Verant Interactive.EverQuestOn March 16, 1999, EverQuest launched and carried both the Verant Interactive and 989 Studios logos on the box. The game quickly exceeded Sony's expectations and became one of the most popular games of all time. Later the same year, the studio released its third game, Infantry, a top-down online combat game, but EverQuest's success was obviously the studio's main focus. Thirteen months after EQ's launch, Verant released the first expansion, The Ruins of Kunark, which added an entire continent, new playable race, and many other new features.Shortly after the release of Kunark, Sony created the brand of Sony Online Entertainment and officially absorbed Verant Interactive under this new banner. Based on EverQuest's success, Sony planned to form a stable of MMO games and needed a brand to house them under. Although, the second expansion, The Scars of Velious, released in December that year, still carried the Verant Interactive logo on the box. In April 2000, Sony created a branch of SOE in Austin, Texas and announced a deal with LucasArts to create a Star Wars MMORPG.Shortly before the release of EQ's third expansion, The Shadows of Luclin, Brad McQuaid, the most prominent face of the game's design team, decided to leave the company along with many others to form Sigil Games. This left much of the expansion's content unfinished when it was released in December 2001. Many players would point to McQuaid's departure as the end of the games best content.Released at the end of 2002, the fourth expansion, The Planes of Power, while still a success in sales, is often considered the point where many of the game's long-time players began leaving the world of Norrath. Not to be forgotten, SOE released another smaller title called Cosmic Rift in the Spring of 2002.Star Wars GalaxiesThe year of 2003 was a massive year for SOE. February saw the fifth EverQuest expansion, The Legacy of Ykesha, which was a smaller amount of content, but added many player requested features such as increased bank size and armor dye. February also saw the first spin-off of the franchise with EverQuest Online Adventures for the PlayStation 2, which allowed console owners to experience the world of Norrath 500 years earlier in its history than PC players. In May, SOE released a second spin-off known as EverQuest: Hero's Call for cell phones and PDA's. Also in May, they released a new brand of MMO with Planetside, a first-person shooter take on the genre. Then, in June, was the juggernaut release of Star Wars Galaxies. EverQuest's sixth expansion, Lost Dungeons of Norrath, released in September, featuring the first appearance of instanced zones in the game. And before the close of 2003, SOE released expansions for both Planetside (Core Combat) and EQ Online Adventures ( Frontiers). SOE closed out 2003 with the release of a third spin-off of the EQ franchise with an RTS called Lords of EverQuest.In February 2004, SOE released the seventh expansion to EQ, Gates of Discord, and a fourth spin-off of the franchise, Champions of Norrath, which allowed players to explore Norrath through a Diablo style hack 'n slash action game. The eighth expansion, Omens of War, was released in September and increased the level cap to 70. This was followed by the first expansion for Star Wars Galaxies, Jump to Lightspeed in October. SOE opened a studio in Seattle in October as well. But, in November, the true sequel to SOE's star franchise was released when EverQuest II hit the shelves. Alongside the release, SOE launched their Station Players website that featured player profiles, leaderboards, guild pages, and item databases for all of their games.In January 2005, SOE announced a new program called Platform Publishing allowing third party developers a channel to get their games published through SOE. This program has led to the release of titles such as Pirates of the Burning Sea, Frantix, Gripshift, and Disney's Toontown Online. February saw the infamous implementation of \"/pizza\" into EverQuest II, as well as the release of the Champions of Norrath sequel, Champions: Return to Arms, and the ninth expansion to the original game, Dragons of Norrath. SOE joined the launch of the PSP in March with Untold Legends, then went on to release adventure packs for EverQuest II and Rage of the Wookiees for SWG through the Summer. They also opened the Station Exchange website in June, a controversial marketplace where players could buy, sell, and trade in-game items for EverQuest II. In July, SOE acquired The Matrix Online from Sega and announced a deal with DC Comics to produce a new MMO. September saw the release of an expansion for each of the main two branches of the EverQuest franchise with Depths of Darkhollow, the tenth expansion for the original game, and Desert of Flames, the first expansion for the sequel.Vanguard: Saga of HeroesFebruary 2006 saw another pair of expansions. The Prophecy of Ro marked the eleventh expansion for the original game, while Kingdom of Sky increased the level cap to 70 in the sequel. March brought a sequel to SOE's PSP title Untold Legends: Warrior's Code, then in May, they released Field Commander, which is explained by many as Advance Wars for PSP. The biggest announcement of the year for SOE though was in March when it was revealed that Brad McQuaid was returning to SOE along with all of SIgil Games. After a deal with Microsoft fell through, SOE picked up Sigil to publish Vanguard: Saga of Heroes. A deal was also announced to publish Gods & Heroes, although the game did not see a retail release until many years later through another publisher. In August, SOE acquired Worlds Apart Productions, a leader in card games, and renamed them SOE Denver. The twelfth expansion to EverQuest, The Serpent's Spine, introduced a new playable race for the first time in many years. November brought the release of the third expansion to EQII, Echoes of Faydwer, and a PlayStation 3 launch title, Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom. And in December, SOE Denver released Pirates Constructable Strategy Game in partnership with WizKids.In January 2007, Vanguard: Saga of Heroes was released as a mostly unfinished product and did not garner much support from players. SOE signed a deal to release classic Midway arcade titles on PSN including Q*Bert, Gauntlet II, Rampart, Rampage, Joust, and Mortal Kombat II. In April, SOE Denver released Stargate Online Trading Card Game. Then, in July, SOE announced development of a new MMO called The Agency for both PC and PlayStation 3. September saw the release of a fifth EverQuest spin-off, Legends of Norrath, a collectible card game where cards could drop in both EverQuest and EverQuest II. In October, almost out of nowhere, SOE added the Black Ops empire to Planetside. November saw yet another pair of expansion for the EQ franchise. The Secrets of Faydwer increased the original game's level cap to 80, and Rise of Kunark did the same for the sequel while also bringing back one of the most beloved areas of Norrath.In January 2008, EverQuest won an Emmy at the 59th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards in the category for Development of Massively Multiplayer Online Graphical Role Playing Games. SOE also announced that the original EverQuest game would now receive only one expansion per year, rather than the normal two. Seeds of Destruction, the fifteenth expansion, would be released in October. The fifth expansion to EverQuest II, The Shadow Odyssey, was released the month after.In 2009, SOE released a new surprisingly successful online game known as Free Realms. At the end of July, The Matrix Online was shut down for good, which was the first SOE-run MMO to be closed. In March, the company celebrated the 10th anniversary of EverQuest, and the sixteenth expansion for the game, Underfoot, was released in December.In 2010, the sixth EverQuest II expansion, Sentinel's Fate, was released and increased the level cap to 90, while the seventeenth expansion to EverQuest, House of Thule, also increased th elevel cap to 90 and introduced player housing to the game. At the 2010 SOE Fan Faire in Las Vegas, John Smedley announced the development of EverQuest Next, which was a working title for what was described as a reimagining of the world of Norrath.In January 2011, SOE released DC Universe Online for both PC and PlayStation 3. The game originally only had a $15/month model, but, in October 2011, a free-to-play model was introduced while still allowing subscribers many benefits over free players. In November, EverQuest players saw the eighteenth expansion to the game, Veil of Alaris. Expansions for EverQuest II continued with Destiny of Velious in February and Age of Discovery in December. At the 2011 SOE Fan Faire, the company officially confirmed development of PlanetSide 2 as well as the in-house development engine known as Forge Light. This new engine would be used not only for PlanetSide 2, but EverQuest Next as well. December saw the closure of the long running MMO, Star Wars: Galaxies - An Empire Divided.In March of 2012, coinciding with the celebration of thirteen years of EverQuest, Sony Online Entertainment introduced a free-to-play model to the game that started it all. Players could play for free to a certain point, while subscribers continued to receive many benefits. At the end of March, SOE shut down the PS2 MMO, EverQuest Online Adventures, after eight years. On January 24th 2014, SOE announced the closure of four games: Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures, Free Realms, Wizardry Online, and Vanguard: Saga of Heroes.On February 2nd, 2015 Columbus Nova, an investment firm from New York, announced that it had acquired Sony Online Entertainment and rebranded it as Daybreak Game Company, LLC.",

    "description": "Silicon Knights was founded in 1992 by Denis Dyack in his home town of St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The studio began as a developer of PC games, but transitioned to console development in in 1996 to make games for the Sony Playstation, beginning with Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain.In 1998, the Canadian developer was signed by Nintendo to be an exclusive second party developer. Under that deal, Silicon Knights developed only two games: Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, the latter of which was overseen by both Konami and Nintendo. Both titles were published on the Nintendo GameCube.Silicon Knights's exclusive relationship with Nintendo ended in 2004, and in 2005 Sega announced a partnership with the studio. However, nothing of this partnership ever took form.Too Human began development as a title for the original PlayStation, but progress was shelved while Silicon Knights worked on Eternal Darkness and Metal Gear Solid. After the split from Nintendo, the studio revisited the Too Human concept and restarted the game's development as an Xbox 360 title. It was published by Microsoft in 2007 and was intended to be the first part of a trilogy.However, a cool critical reception and poor sales of Too Human delayed those plans. At around the same time, Silicon Knights became embroiled in a legal argument with Epic Games over the use and support of the Unreal Engine 3. Silicon Knights claimed that Epic provided insufficient support for the engine, hampering their development on Too Human while Epic used the licensing profits to develop Gears of War. Epic retaliated with a countersuit. Silicon Knights abandoned use of UE3 in favor of developing their own engine for Too Human and future projects.In 2011, Silicon Knights partnered with Activision Blizzard and released X-Men: Destiny to average to poor reviews. It was later alleged that the studio had used development funds granted to them by Activision intended for X-Men: Destiny to instead work in secret on a tech demo for a potential Eternal Darkness sequel. Further compounding Silicon Knights's troubles, the company lost their suit against Epic in large part due to the fact that the game engine code in Too Human and X-Men: Destiny, supposedly created using a new internal engine, in fact featured large chunks of code taken from the Unreal Engine. As part of Epic's legal victory, the court ordered all unsold copies of both Too Human and X-Men: Destiny destroyed.Since the release of X-Men: Destiny, the vast majority of the staff at Silicon Knights, including Denis Dyack, have left the company. What remains of the studio has been locked in legal appeals to Epic's triumph in court.",

    "description": "The first game to be released by \"On-Line-Systems\" was Mystery House in 1980. The game was based on a concept penned by Roberta Williams, she was inspired after playing text-only adventure games and considered the possibility of blending solid game design with a on-screen representations of the game world. Roberta's husband Ken Williams, at the time a programmer for IBM, took on the task of creating a home computer game based on his wife's concepts. The formula and balance between graphic representation of the game world and the user interface at the bottom of the screen would be the prevalent form of adventure games for years to come.Following the success and the company's relocation to Oakhurst, California in 1982, the name was changed to \"Sierra On-line systems\", a nod to the Sierra Nevada Hills where the new headquarters were to be located. Over the next few years, Sierra On-Line Systems released an impressive array of highly successful and influential adventure games including the legendary King's Quest Series. Other successful series and franchises developed and/or published by Sierra On-Line Systems were Gabriel Knight , Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry. Sierra also released a few stand-alone adventures, such as The Black Cauldron (based on the Disney picture) and The Wizard and the Princess. Despite releasing games of other genres as well, such as Caesar and Lords of the Realm, Sierra's name became synonymous with engaging and quirky adventure gaming.Acquisitions of small independent developers further broadened the catalogue and range of Sierra products. Dynamix was acquired in 1990 and released critically acclaimed war simulations as well as the evergreen The Incredible Machine which has seen many sequels and reincarnations on many platforms since. Further companies bought by Sierra included Coktel Vision ( Gobliiins), Impression Games ( Caesar Series, High Seas Trader), Papyrus Design Group, SubLogic, Bright Star Technologies and Berkeley Systems ( You Don't know Jack). Sierra also looked to expand its home productivity lines; the acquisition of Green Thumb Software, Print Design and Aria Software expanded Sierra's catalogue by print machines, home gardening products and culinary books series respectively.1995 was a year of ambition and success for Sierra. Earnings improved by almost 20 % and the software released by Sierra included highly anticipated Phantasmagoria which received mixed reviews but sold rather well and has since gained a cult status, although it is quite hard to track down original copies. Furthermore, Sierra released The Realm Online, one of the first MMORPG to be released for the home computer and is still played to this day.Beginning in 1996, Sierra went through a series of acquisitions and changes of parent companies including CUC, Cendant Software and Havas Interactive, which is a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal.In 2002 Sierra was renamed Sierra Entertainment. The next few years proved to be difficult and the titles they released found only minor success (Homeworld 2) if any at all. Some games, such as the rebirth of the Leisure Suit Larry Series (without it's creator Al Lowe on Board) were torn apart by critics and sold poorly. In 2008 Vivendi Games merged with Activision to became the Activision Blizzard company.With Vivendi Games ceasing to exist, the Sierra brand became the property of Activision for possible future reanimation or sale. Activision exercised that option in August 2014, reviving the Sierra name as a small publishing label for both revived Sierra properties and newer concepts, as well. The first two games announced by this new incarnation of Sierra are a new King's Quest game and Geometry Wars 3.The company logo displays an image of Half Dome, one of the most noticeable landmarks in Yosemite National Park, which is only miles from the company's longtime home of Oakhurst.",

    "description": "Founders of Blizzard (Left to Right): Pearce, Morhaime and AdhamBlizzard Entertainment was founded by Allen Adham, Michael Morhaime and Frank Pearce on February 1991. After graduating from UCLA a year before, the three computing graduates decided to form a gaming company called Silicon & Synapse, which referred to the building block of the computer (silicon) and the human mind (synapse).Under that name, the company developed games for the Super NES like Rock n' Roll Racing, The Lost Vikings and Blackthorne. Silicon & Synapse garnered many awards within those years but received backlash for its company name. Many mistook it to be a breast implant firm because of the word \"silicon,\" which led them to briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios but it did not help either. Many people had trouble pronouncing the name (mispronunciations ranged from \"chows\" to \"Chads\") and discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.In early 1994 they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for $6.75 million. The same year the three year old gaming company switched its name to Ogre Studios but Davidson & Associates went against it because they felt \"ogre\" was too scary for the target audience. Finally, after numerous discussions within the team, they finally settled on Blizzard Entertainment.Blizzard's three main intellectual properties include the Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo franchises. Each franchise boasts an impressive, and almost \"cult-like\" following of fans, that have made Blizzard one of the most easily recognizable names in the gaming industry today.In July 2008 Vivendi Games, who at the time owned Blizzard Entertainment, merged with game publisher Activision. Using Blizzard's name as a marketing tool to promote the company and deal as a merger and not a direct buyout, named the resulting company Activision Blizzard.A \"Murky\" pet that was given away to attendees of the first Blizzcon in 2005.It is due to this incredible community that has developed around these three unique IPs and the unprecedented success of their hit titles like StarCraft and World of Warcraft that Blizzard is able to host it's own convention's; namely BlizzCon and the Worldwide Invitational (or WWI). These conventions boast a number of incredible events such as tournaments for Warcraft 3, StarCraft, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft arena tournaments, costume and machinima contests, as well as major announcements concerning their three flagship franchises.The first BlizzCon was held in Anaheim, California at the Anaheim Convention Center in 2005 and has since been held on a semi-regular basis. It has been held since in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In July 2008, Blizzard announced they would be partnering with DirectTV to televise BlizzCon 2008.The third Worldwide Invitational was held in May 2007 in Seoul, Korea and featured the unveiling of the highly anticipated StarCraft II. The fourth WWI was held in Paris, France in June 2008 with the announcement of Diablo III and information concerning the second expansion to their massive multiplayer online RPG World of Warcraft, The Wrath of the Lich King. Previous WWI events were held in Seoul, Korea and featured professional, or \"eSports\" tournaments but no new product announcements.On top of the many prizes and tournaments going on, Blizzard has also made a habit out of giving away special codes that can be redeemed in World of Warcraft for different aesthetic purposes. Things such as in-game pets that follow a player around, or a suit that dresses them up are just a few things that Blizzard has given away exclusively at their events.Blizzard has announced and is holding the next Blizzcon in August of 2009. The convention will, as the previous Blizzcon of 2008, be available to non-attendee's through DirectTV for a nominal fee. It will also be available for purchase to be viewed via a streaming feed online.Blizzard has announced that BlizzCon 2010 is scheduled for October 2010 at the Anaheim Convention Center.Blizzard canceled BlizzCon 2012, in order to have more time to work on their current projects.In 1997 Blizzard released an online gaming service called Battle.net that allows players from around the world to play together for free. This service has been implemented into most of Blizzard's titles. Battle.net has an array of functions including a matchmaking service and custom gameplay support that allows players to create their own maps and game types to share and play online. One such game type called Defense of the Ancients (or DoTA) in WarCraft 3 has since grown to become somewhat of a phenomenon similar to the original Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life.With the release of StarCraft II, Blizzard announced that an all new Battle.net service titled Battle.net 2.0 will launch concurrently with the game. Battle.net 2.0 features cross game features with all upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, including backwards compatibility with World of WarCraft. In 2009, Blizzard required all World of Warcraft accounts be changed into battle.net accounts to prepare for the service.RPM Racing (1991)The Lost Vikings (1992)Rock N' Roll Racing (1993)Blackthorne (1994)The Death and Return of Superman (1994)Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994)Justice League Task Force (1995)Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness (1995)Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal (1996)Diablo (1996)The Lost Vikings II (1997)StarCraft (1998)StarCraft: Brood War (1998)Diablo II (2000)Diablo II: Lord of Destruction (2001)Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (2002)Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (2003)World of Warcraft (2004)World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade (2007)World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (2008)StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010)World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (2010)Diablo III (2012)World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria (2012)StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm (2013)Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft (2014)Diablo III: Reaper of Souls (2014)World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor (2014)Heroes of the Storm (2015)StarCraft II: Legacy of the VoidOverwatchWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the ClansStarCraft GhostTitanMichael Morhaime - President and co-founder (1991 - present)Frank Pearce Jr. - Senior Vice President and co-founder (1991 - present)Sam Didier - Art Director (1992 - present)Joeyray Hall - DVD/ Video Production Supervisor (1992 - present)Bob Fitch - Lead Software Engineer (1993 - present)Chris Metzen - Vice President of Creative Development (1994 - present)Nick Carpenter - Executive Art Director (1994 - present)Shane Dabiri - Lead Producer (1994 - present)Matt Samia - Vice-President/ Cinematics & Media (1995 - present)Paul W.

Blizzard threatened legal action and filed a lawsuit against the developers which eventually caused the service to shut down.The three viking characters (Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout) from Blizzard's game \"The Lost Vikings\" can be found in their MMORPG World of Warcraft in the Uldaman dungeon camping in a side tunnel off of the main zone.Notable title cancellations from Blizzard include Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans which was cancelled in 1998, Shattered Nations, StarCraft: Ghost which was \"indefinetely postponed\" in 2006 and Titan which was cancelled in 2014 after seven years of development.Blizzard was honored in 2008 at the 59th Annual Technology & Enginerring Emmy Awards for the creation of World of Warcraft. The award was accepted by Michael Morhaime.It has been announced by Blizzard that they will be producing a live-action Warcraft movie to be released by Legendary Pictures.Blizzard was originally to be the company to publish Pax Imperia II but the project was dropped when it was decided that it would be in conflict with their other space-based RTS StarCraft. THQ eventually struck a deal with Heliotrope to have the game published under the title Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain.",

He entered an exclusive negotiating deal with Terry Phillips of SouthPeak in order to prevent GameCock from drying up entirely and in less than a week on October 14, 2008 the acquisition was complete. SouthPeak's strategy in dealing with the outstanding debts of GameCock was to inform the debtors that they were going to pay half of what was owed, and if the debtor didn't like it they could sue. Further investigation revealed that this was SouthPeak's general stance towards debt and continued while they were posting record profits.The GameCock troubles did not end there. In early 2008 a deal between CDV and GameCock had been made essentially licensing seven games from GameCock to CDV ( Dementium, Insecticide, Mushroom Men, Velvet Assassin, Hail to the Chimp, Pirates vs. Ninjas and Stronghold Crusader Extreme). However, four of those titles slipped out of 2008 while GameCock was being acquired. SouthPeak continued to publish those four titles, and CDV sued them for copyright infringement and breach of contract, winning both accounts in a German court.Development studios working for SouthPeak have filed litigation on unpaid expenses repeatedly to mixed success. The most recent of these is Paradox Interactive who filed on March 19, 2010 claiming that SouthPeak was delinquent on over $500,000 of payment for software sales. SouthPeak has claimed that it is now insolvent and unable to make payment.During the Midway bankruptcy proceedings in late 2009, SouthPeak acquired the license for TNA Impact in hopes to produce another title.",

    "description": "Half-LifeCounter-StrikeTeam FortressDay of DefeatPortalLeft 4 DeadGordon & AlyxValve Software was founded in Bellevue, Washington in 1996. They quickly made their mark on PC gaming history with their debut title, Half-Life--a game which went on to receive numerous \"Game of the Year\" awards and is still widely regarded as one of the most influential FPS games ever made. Half-Life went on to spawn two official expansion packs (Opposing Force and Blue Shift, both developed by Gearbox, not Valve) and several multiplayer mods, including Counter-Strike, which for years after its release has consistently remained one of the most-played online shooters.After the success of Half-Life, Valve stayed fairly quiet for a number of years, tending to the burgeoning mod communities to which Half-Life had given rise and doing R&D work on their next game engine. Finally, in 2004, Valve again shook the world of PC games with the critically acclaimed sequel to Half-Life, simply titled Half-Life 2. The game quickly became renowned for its atmospheric story-telling, polished gameplay, and robust physics system that could be easily and dramatically manipulated via the Gravity Gun. Released alongside Half-Life 2 was a full remake of their popular online shooter Counter-Strike, titled Counter-Strike: Source. Both Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source were Valve's first games to make use of their new, in-house-developed Source Engine.Portal - A picture is worth a thousand words.Valve planned for episodic game releases to continue the Half-Life 2 storyline, and they released the first of these in 2006, titled Half-Life 2: Episode One. Following the release of Episode One, Valve began work on The Orange Box. The Orange Box became a five-game package for the PC, Xbox 360, and PS3, which included HL2, HL2: Episode One, HL2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Team Fortress 2, having been in fitful iterative development for nearly a decade, is the sequel to the popular multiplayer game Team Fortress: Classic, though it takes a much more stylized approach with visuals reminiscent of a Pixar film. Portal, inspired by a student project titled Narbacular Drop, is unusual among Valve's games and among first-person games in general in that it is not exactly a first-person shooter, but rather a first-person puzzler. The game saw the player navigating the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using a Portal Gun to teleport and maneuver through physics-based puzzles. The Orange Box was released in 2007, and garnered much critical acclaim for the variety, quality, and overall value of the games comprising it. Over the years since Team Fortress 2's release, Valve has set an industry-wide precedent for substantial and long-lasting post-release game support through their class updates and other TF2 DLC, all completely free to players.Main Characters for Left 4 DeadFollowing in the wake of Counter-Strike: Source's and Team Fortress 2's success, Valve's next game was to be another online multiplayer shooter, but with a tighter cooperative emphasis, in Left 4 Dead, released at the end of 2008 for PC and Xbox 360. Inspired by the simple fun of fighting off hordes of knife-wielding bots in Counter-Strike, Left 4 Dead pits a lone band of four survivors against hordes of zombies in the aftermath of a full-blown zombie apocalypse. In a new speed record for Valve, they released a full sequel to Left 4 Dead just one year later to some fan backlash in Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2 added more content of almost every form to the Left 4 Dead formula, while also retaining much of the content from the first game.In 2010, Valve released Alien Swarm, a Source-engine remake of the popular UT2004 mod developed by the original mod's developers who Valve hired several years earlier. Alien Swarm is available on Steam for free.Portals main characters- Chell and GladosPortal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010 after a week-long alternate reality game which involved updates to the original game. Before the game was released, Valve released the Potato Sack, a second alternate reality game which involved 13 games and ultimately ended up in releasing the game several hours early on April 19, 2011. Portal 2 continues the story of Portal and adds a number of new game-play mechanics such as laser redirection, paint-like gels that can accelerate the players speed, place portals on any surface and jump higher.On October 13, 2010 Dota 2 was officially announced on a Game Informer cover story after being hinted at in 2009. When Valve acquired the franchise, there was a trademark dispute between Valve and Blizzard with Blizzard claiming that the term Dota was an asset of their games community but it was later settled on May 11, 2012. The beta began in 2011 and officially released in July 2013 prior to Valves tournament The International 3. Valve was set up on August 24th 1996 by two former Microsoft employees: Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. They were based in Kirkland, WA and were a Limited Liable Company (L.L.C). While still at Microsoft both Newell and Harrington played key roles in the development and success of Microsoft's Window's operating system.Gabe Newell.After acquiring the rights to the Quake Engine from id Software Valve began working on their first game Half-life. Set to become a company tradition, the game suffered several delays and restarts and was pushed back from it's intended release in 1997 to the end of 1998.The game was eventually released on November 19th 1998 by Sierra Online. It received universal accolades for it's immersive environments, interactiveness and unique narrative all while still being a solid FPS. This was combined with commercial success and as of 2008 the game has sold in excess of 9.8 million copies.Valve would continue the development philosophy on Half-life in their later games which is a partial reason to their success and loyal fanbase.What Valve Corporation is best known for is their big support for user created content. When Half-Life was first released in 1998, mods were created to expand the multiplayer, the most prominent being Counter Strike. When Counter Strike was first released as a free mod, it quickly became a hit. Valve liked what they saw in the mod and on April 20, 2000, Valve hired the Counter Strike developers in order to make a full game out of the mod. Thus Half Life: Counter Strike was born.Many other mods would be created for Half Life, including Team Fortress (which was released as a Quake mod before coming to Half Life) and Day of Defeat.Scene from Garry's ModWhen Valve released the Steam client in 2003, there wasn't much support in their store. As they expanded within the next few years, Valve decided to bring some modders and indie developers to make games for the Steam service. Valve gives modders the proper tools to make mods. When Half Life 2 was released, it introduced the new Source engine. To better attract modders, Valve released the Source SDK. It became the standard tool to create new maps, new enemies, and whole new mods for Valve's titles.The most famous of all of the new Source mods is Garry's Mod. Created in 2004 by Garry Newman, Garry's Mod was a simple construction tool used to play in maps with the ragdolls from many Source games, life Half Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2, and Left 4 Dead. It soon became one of the biggest mods for Half Life 2. Now the simple mod has expanded into an expansive tool used by many people, from modders to machinima makers. In fact, version 11 is available on Steam and is now considered a full game (but still requires the owner own another Source based game to run).Indie games became an important part of Steam. With the introduction of Steamworks, Valve has been trying to get the community involved with the service. Games like Audiosurf and World of Goo became a big part of the Steam service, expanding its library of games from the regular publishers to the new indie developers getting a good start in gaming.Scene from Half-life.August 24th, 1996 - Valve Software is set up by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington.November 19th, 1998 - Half-life is released.March 25th, 1999 - Counter Strike is released as a mod for Half-life.April 7th, 1999 - Team Fortress Classic is released, a remake of the original Quake mod based on the GoldSrc engine.January 15th 2000 - Mike Harrington dissolves his partnership with Valve, giving Gabe Newell full control.April 20th, 2000 - Valve hires the developers of Counter Strike.2003 - Valve moves to Bellvue, WA after becoming a corporation.September 12th, 2003 - Valve releases its Steam client.November 16th, 2004 - Half-life 2 is finally released, after numerous delays and complications, to glowing reviews.June 1st 2006 - HL2: Episode 1 is released.

    "description": "DMA Design was created in 1988 by David Jones, Russell Kay, Steve Hammond and Mike Dailly in Dundee, Scotland. They partnered with the UK-based company Psygnosis, who would later create the Wipeout series, to make a number of 2D sidescrolling shooters, including Menace for the Amiga and Commodore 64.DMA's major breakthrough was in 1990 with Lemmings, a 2D platformer. It was released on the Amiga, NES and Mac selling over 20 million copies. The years beyond this were spent creating many more Lemmings games, including Christmas special editions. In 1993, Psygnosis were bought out by Sony and this would start the beginning of their troubled relationship. DMA released Uniracers as their first game without Psygnosis shortly after. In 1994, DMA wereasked by major console giant Nintendo to design a game for their upcoming Ultra 64 system, now known as the Nintendo 64. DMA designed a game called Body Harvest, however numerous changes were asked to be included in order appeal to the Japanese market. After many delays Nintendo dropped out of publishing the game, and Midway Games took over.In the meantime DMA was releasing Grand Theft Auto on the PC while another developer ported it to the Playstation. It used a number of ideas from Body Harvest, the 2D top down perspective and the ability to get into any car was a major focus. The game followed a character who would make his way up the criminal ranks in three fictional US cities. The game sparked controversy due to its display of violence; especially the British newspaper Daily Mail which said it should be banned. This controversy was likely a benefactor to the game's success.GTA IV's protagonist, Nico Bellic.After the success of Grand Theft Auto, DMA was bought by Gremlin interactive. During this time DMA put out two games, Body Harvest for the PC and Wild Metal Country. In 1999 Gremlin was bought out by Infogrames, complicating things for DMA as they had an existing deal with Sony. In the end Gremlin sold DMA to Take Two Interactive and the existing deal with Sony was called Rockstar Games. For the rest of the 1990s DMA released Wild Metal for the Dreamcast and Grand Theft Auto 2 for the PC and Playstation.In 2001 Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto III using Criterions graphics middleware RenderWare on the Playstation 2. The game became a huge success in the US and EU; because of this Sony signed a deal to keep the game exclusive. It was at this point that Rockstar bought DMA and changed their name to Rockstar North in 2002.The following year would see the massive release of the PC version of Grand Theft Auto III and the release of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. In 2003 a port was made for Vice City and GTA 3 to Microsofts Xbox and to the PC. The developer would then change and go a different route in 2003 releasing the hyper-violent Manhunt on PS2. The company then went back to GTA the following year releasing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas to huge critical and commercial acclaim.The time from 2004 was spent readying Rockstar North for the next generation of consoles with the release of GTA IV on the Xbox 360 and PS3 in April 2008. Rockstar North released The Lost and the Damned, as well as The Ballad of Gay Tony in 2009 as DLC packs for the 360. Both DLC's were being released for the Playstation 3 in the spring of 2010.As of July 2010, Rockstar North is working on Agent, an exclusive for the Playstation 3. Details about the game are scarce at this time.Announced October 25th, 2011, Rockstar North is developing GTA V.",

    "description": "Tose is a Japanese developer that was founded in 1979 as a spin-off from Toa Seiko, a Japanese electronics and technology development firm. Specializing predominantly in outsourced work from other development companies in both Japan and overseas, although it is only officially credited on a handful of games, most notably all of the Game & Watch Gallery games, as well as the Starfy franchise, which is its own creation, Tose is believed to have been involved in the development of 1100-plus games for numerous platforms in various capacities over the years ranging from graphics support to full development. However, since it routinely declines to be credited in most of the games to which they contribute work, it has come to be known as a \"ninja developer,\" with portions of its exact resume largely being made apparent either by clients that make its hiring known, such as Square-Enix for Enix/Dragon Quest franchise-related ports, or by forensic work done on both the games themselves and external resources related to the company. The ways involved in the latter method include financial reports and ROM hacking, among other means.The developer's secrecy extends as far as its work force, with even its upper management often preferring anonymity over having their names made known. Sporting over 1000 employees, Tose is one of the world's largest developers that, with one exception in the form of the PSP Network title Susume Tactics, doesn't also do publishing work. In addition to the main office in Japan, it also maintains branch offices in the United States and China.The following is a list of companies with which Tose has been to known to work as either a fellow game developer or in a game development capacity. Although many of the companies listed are officially disclosed on the company's official Japanese page, if sufficient proof is available via other sources (ie: financial reports, etc.), those companies are also deemed fit for inclusion. Companies that have also merged since their time in working with Tose are also mentioned on the list. As stated in the overview, the sort of work that they handle for their clients is on a case-by-case basis and as such, the extent of their relationships with fellow game developers and publishers is, like their exact work portfolio, largely ambiguous.Amusement VisionAquaplusASCII CorporationAtlusAvex NetworkBanprestoBuena Vista GamesCapcomCaviaChunsoftCyberfrontDeNADigicubeDisney InteractiveD3 PublisherElectronic ArtsEnixFrom SoftwareFujiko F.

    "description": "Neversoft' logoSince it's start in 1994, Neversoft has been growing more and more over the years. During their early years they established the foundation of the company, which later led to the purchase of Neversoft by Activision. The purchase was the beginning of a great time for both Neversoft and Activision. One of their first games together, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, gained great critical acclaim and paved the way to a successfull future.Neversoft continued to develop games in the Tony Hawk franchise until 2007 when Activision offered them to work on the Guitar Hero franchise instead. Their first game, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, became a great success and made over $100 million in its first week of release in North America, and as of July 2008, the game has sold more then 8 million copies worldwide.The Neversoft team in 1998In July 1994, Neversoft was founded by Joel Jewett, Mick West and Chris Ward in Woodland Hills, California. They initially worked for Playmates Toys, where they begun development of a game for the Sega Genesis to go along with a cartoon show called Skeleton Warriors.In December 1994, five months later, the game was cancelled by Playmates Toys. Not because they were unhappy with the development progress, but because they wanted to join the 32-bit bandwagon and develop the game for the new Sega Saturn. At this time, Neversoft had expanded by hiring two additional employees; a level designer and another artist.1995 was spent developing Skeleton Warriors for the Sega Saturn. Over the course of this year, Neversoft grew rapidly by hiring three programmers, five artists, a level designer, a tester and an office administrator. Skeleton Warriors was finished in time for the holiday season and Neversoft started to look for new work while they were porting the game to the Playstation.In 1996 Neversoft's staff grew to over twenty people. For six months they worked on a game based on Ghost Rider for Crystal Dynamics, which later was cancelled due to financial problems with the publisher. This gave them time and opportunity to work on a game of their own design called Big Guns. The engine they created for Big Guns was also to be used in their next project; they got the opportunity to convert the PC game MDK to the Playstation. Towards the end of the year, Sony Computer Entertainment bought the idea for Big Guns from Neversoft, and the game was now officially in development.1997 was a tumultuous year for Neversoft. The MDK conversion were more complex and took far longer than expected, and the Big Guns game, which had been renamed to Exodus went through numerous design changes to satisfy Sony, but it was eventually cancelled in November 1997. The company shrunk back to just twelve employees. Neversoft then spent the next few months improving on their engine, while looking for more work.In January 1998, Neversoft was about to run out of money, but luckily they had a fortunate business meeting with Activision, who were looking for developers for Apocalypse. Their Big Guns engine was ideal for the project and Activision and Neversoft sealed a business deal.In May 1998 the development of Apocalypse was going along nicely, and Activision additionally requested a prototype of a skateboarding game from Neversoft. The development of the prototype was going really slow, since Neversoft really couldn't spare anyone from the development of Apocalypse. The initial prototypes impressed Activision, and when Apocalypse was done in October 1998, Neversoft immediately begun working on what later should become known as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for the Playstation and Nintendo 64. At this time Neversoft consisted 15 people: six programmers, five artists, three level designers and Joel, the President.In the summer of 1999, their successful cooperation led to Activision acquiring Neversoft by a stock-swap deal.In October 1999, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was released. Due to the game's great reception, Neversoft started development of a sequel immediately. Meanwhile, Neversoft also started development of Spider-Man, which meant Neversoft had to split into two separate development teams working in parallel.In 2000, both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and Spider-Man were released, and Neversoft started development of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for Playstation 2 using the RenderWare engine.In 2001, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was released, and Neversoft once again immediately started working on a sequel.In 2002, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 was released as well as a port of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the Xbox.In 2003, Neversoft reworked the Tony Hawk franchise a bit, by taking a more story-oriented approach in Tony Hawk's Underground, which was released the same year.In 2004, Tony Hawk's Underground 2 was released. Neversoft once again decided to split the team into two groups to work on two games at once; the seventh game in the Tony Hawk franchise and the new game GUN.In 2005, both Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and GUN was released.In 2006, Tony Hawk's Project 8 was both developed and released. This was Neversoft's first game to hit the new generation of consoles consisting of Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. Yet again, Neversoft started development of another Tony Hawk game.In 2007, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground was released. This turned out to be the last Tony Hawk game developed by Neversoft, since Activision recently acquired RedOctane and wanted Neversoft to continue the Guitar Hero franchise. Neversoft began development of what was to become Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock immediately and shipped the game later the same year. The Tony Hawk franchise was given to Robomodo.In 2008, Neversoft released the Guitar Hero spin-off title Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, which mainly - as the name suggests - features songs from the world famous rock band Aerosmith. Later the same year, a direct sequel to Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock called Guitar Hero: World Tour was released. Given the success of full band gameplay from Harmonix's Rock Band, it was deemed necessary to include full band support in Guitar Hero: World Tour as well.In 2009, yet another spin-off title was released. This time it was Guitar Hero: Metallica, which included many songs from the world famous heavy metal band.At the end of 2009, Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero and Guitar Hero: Van Halen were released. All games featured full band game play, but were targeted at different audiences; Band Hero contained more family-friendly songs and Guitar Hero: Van Halen was the third band specific Guitar Hero game to be released.",

    "description": "Treyarch is an Activision-owned game development studio jointly responsible for the primary direction of the Call of Duty (initially started by Infinity Ward) and Spiderman (initially developed by Neversoft in its current form) video game franchises.Treyarch was founded as an independent game development studio in 1996 by Peter Akemann and Don Likeness in Santa Monica, California. The company's original name was Treyarch Invention, LLC and initially found critical success with their original title, \" Die By the Sword\" and its expansion pack, \" Limb From Limb\", both published by Interplay. Rapidly growing in size, Treyarch immedietly branched out and released their first sports title, Triple Play 2000, for Electronic Arts in 1999 and its followup the following year.In 2000, Treyarch released their first Dreamcast games: the Mattel-licensed Max Steel: Covert Operations and their original title, Draconus: Cult of the Wurm. While neither would be critial or commercial hits, they provided the company with their first experience with the hardware that would ultimately bring them under Activision's umbrella. They were contracted to port the game Spider-Man (a major hit from the previous year) from the Playstation to the Dreamcast, winning them praise for developing inarguably the best version of the title yet, though the lack of any new content on a game that was over six months old tended to impact the final review scores. While Neversoft's original version received a Metacritic average of 87, Treyarch's port received a composite score of 80.The sports division at Treyarch remained busy churning out favorably received updates to the NHL 2K series (NHL 2K2 and NHL 2K3) for 2K Sports, Triple Play Baseball series for Electronic Arts, and developing the extreme sports / surfing title, \"Kelly Slater Pro Surfer\" for Activision. Their next non-sports title would be Minority Report in 2002, very loosely based on the film of the same title. Critics were strongly negative towards the title (X-Play named it one of the worst PS2 titles of all time in June of 2006), but it has retained a cult following on the internet for its indepth three dimensional beat 'em up combat engine.Activision purchased Treyarch outright in October of 2001 and it was in 2002 that Treyarch was able to finally catapault into the public spotlight with the high sales of their original Spider-Man title (based on the 2002 film of the same name). Despite criticism regarding the quality of the voice acting, game length and indoor camera behavior, reviewers rated the title positively and it went on to sell over three million copies across the console platforms. This success resulted in Treyarch being assigned work on the similarly well received sequel (Spider-Man 2)",

Littlejohns then became president and CEO of Red Storm.Red Storm Entertainment (from here on, RSE) released their first game in 1997, \"Tom Clancy's Politika\". They also quickly released one of the first 3D Real Time Strategy games, \"Dominant Species\".In 1998, RSE became widely known with their release of \"Rainbow Six\", the first tactical FPS in history. Though it was not based on a previous Tom Clancy book, one was released only weeks later. The game was fallowed by the \"Eagle Watch\" mission pack.In 2000, RSE solidified its position in the market with \"Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear\", which was also fallowed by two mission packs, \"Urban Operations\" and \"Black Thorn\". They also expanded into the turn based and military-real time strategy genres, with \"Shadow Watch\" and \"Force 21\" respectively.Later in 2000, the studio was purchased by Ubisoft Entertainment. RSE would soon release its first in-house console developed game, \"Ghost Recon\", which essentially took the tactical shooter gameplay of Rainbow Six, and applied it to a near future territorial conflict in the Caucasus. It was also the first full fledged Xbox LIVE game to take advantage of all its features.In 2003 Ubisoft decided to integrate \"Sinister Games\" into RSE, keeping the headquarters in Morrisville.In 2004, Ubisoft signaled their desire to shift RSE to console focused development with the release of \"Ghost Recon 2\", which was the first RSE game not released on PC. Ghost Recon 2 was also one of the first console games to make downloadable content available. The game was followed by the add-on \"Summit Strike\".Most recently, RSE has been tasked with the development of the multiplayer portions of \"Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter\" and \"Ghost Recon Future Soldier\".",

In 2004, Q Entertainment debuted their first title: Lumines.  The PSP game is one of the best-regarded titles on the platform and has spawned an entire franchise.  A PSP sequel was created in 2006 alongside an Xbox Live Arcade release of the game.  In 2007, Lumines and Lumines II were ported to the PlayStation 2 in the form of Lumines Plus.  The game also became available on PC at that time and was released on Steam in 2008.  Another non-physical release of the game happened in 2008 when Lumines Supernova was released on PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network.  The latest release of the game is an iPhone version named Lumines: Touch Fusion.  The iPhone game was released in 2009.   The game has seen a release on every current generation platform except for the Nintendo DS.    Blasting off in Meteos.     Another Q Entertainment franchise, Meteos, originally debuted on the Nintendo DS in 2005.  A Disney version of the game was released in 2007 and the game was later adapted for the home console market in the form of Meteos Wars, a 2008 release.      Every Extend Extra  In 2006, Q Entertainment released Every Extend Extra for the PSP.  The game is based on the PC game Every Extend, which was supposedly brought to the attention of studio head Tetsuya Mizuguchi after an employee skipped work to play it.  The Q Entertainment title adds a more percussive, electronic soundtrack as well as flashier, more vibrant graphics.  The game was re-made for the Xbox Live Arcade in 2007 and was released as Every Extend Extra Extreme.  Q Entertainment worked with Phantagram on the 2006 Xbox 360 game Ninety-Nine Nights.  They also developed Gunpey for DS and PSP, another 2006 game.  Rez HD In 2008, Mizuguchi's classic Rez was ported to the Xbox 360 (via the Xbox Live Arcade) in the form of Rez HD.  As the title suggests, it is a high-definition update of the game.  It also features 5.1 surround sound and online leaderboards, as well as various audio-visual options not available in other releases of the game.   Q Entertainment also handled the 2009 DS release of Peggle.  Mizuguchi demonstrating Child of Eden with Kinect at E3 2010.    At the E3 2010 Ubisoft press conference, Q Entertainment announced Child of Eden, a spiritual successor to Rez.  Mizuguchi demonstrated the gameplay using Microsoft's Kinect controller.  It is undetermined whether or not the game will support Sony's Move controller as well as if the game will be a digital or physical release.",

The game received critical acclaim from gamers and reviewers alike, which resulted in more than 50 \"Game of The Year\" awards.In 2005, Call of Duty 2 was released for both the PC and Xbox 360, where it became the first Xbox 360 game to reach over 1 million units sold. It was also the most played Xbox Live game from November 2005 to April 2006.Two years later, in late 2007, Call of Duty 4: Modern warfare was released on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. It was the first game in the series to leave World War II, which it instead changed with a modern setting. The game became a huge success for Infinity Ward both in terms of sales and reviews.In 2008, Infinity Ward was named the game developer of the year in Game Developer Magazine.In November 2009, Infinity Ward released the much anticipated sequel to 2007's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, titled Modern Warfare 2. It was the first direct sequel to a Call of Duty game, including many of the characters from the previous game. It received very positive reviews overall with a Metacritic rating of 95. Reviewer Jeff Gerstmann wrote: \"If you've ever been interested in a first-person shooter, buy this game.\" Over 2 million players were classified on the Xbox 360 Multiplayer leaderboards within 24 hours of the game's release.On March 1 2010, the two studio heads Vince Zampella and Jason West, which both originated from 2015, were suddenly taken away from the studio without warning to a meeting with Activision. Several hours later they reappeared from the meeting unemployed. As of this writing, lawsuits are flying in both directions and nothing conclusive has been announced.April 2010 marked the resignations of more than 10 Infinity Ward employees, including the several lead designers, programmers and engineers. This exodus came days after the announcement of West and Zampella's new studio Respawn Entertainment.",

    "description": "Ubisoft Montreal is a subsidiary of French giant Ubisoft. It is located in the province of Quebec, in Canada. With over 2500 employees, it is one of the biggest development studios in the world.The Assassin's Creed TeamFollowing the collapse of the Montreal manufacturing and textile industry in the late 1990s, the local political party in charge at the time - Parti Quebecois - needed a plan for job creation. They saw the potential of the growing multimedia industry at the time and started an initiative to turn Montreal into a multimedia hub. Called \"Plan Mercure\", it proposed subsidiaries for investing companies. After preliminary negotiations with Ubisoft, the plan hit a roadblock when it was deemed financially untenable for the government. But public & media pressure persevered and Plan Mercure was eventually implemented in 1997 when Ubisoft finally set up their Montreal studio, with heavily subsidized jobs. Over the course of five years, 500 jobs were subsidized as the Quebec government contributed $15,000 per employee with the federal government contributing another $10,000 per employee. The policy did bear fruit in the long run since by 2010, the studio employed over 2500 employees in the area.Since the creation of Ubisoft Montreal, other publishers like EA, Eidos, THQ & Warner Bros have also set up similar development houses in the area. In addition to heavy subsidization, Ubisoft has also cited the French speaking population and the area's low rent as reasons for choosing Montreal over other considered locations like New Brunswick.Sam Fisher's adventures marked the beginning of a successful franchise.After developing Tonic Trouble & Goin' Quackers, games aimed at a younger audience, Ubisoft Montreal's first big release was 2002's Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. The game put players in the role NSA agent Sam Fisher resolving global conflicts through espionage. It was critically lauded and led to the creation of a long running franchise. In 2003, they released Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time which met with even more success, winning multiple Game of the Year awards and revitalized the classic franchise. Over the next few years, Ubisoft Montreal's main success came from iterating on these titles.In 2006, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas was released on multiple platforms and was one of the first big budget titles on the new generation of consoles. Vegas marked a new course for the Rainbow Six franchise, switching the emphasis from the traditional heavy tactical mission pre-planning to the in-the-moment action.One of Ubisoft Montreal's best-selling games.In 2007, Ubisoft Montreal released Assassin's Creed as part of a new IP, where players take control of an assassin during tumultuous historical times like the Crusades or Renaissance. With a positive critical response and over 8 million sales, the first Assassin's Creed still remains their biggest commercial success yet. Since then, they have continued to iterate on the franchise, with continued financial and critical success. Since then the company has released Assassin's Creed II and Revelations, with the series looking to become an annual franchise. They also picked up the reigns of the Far Cry franchise from CryTek and released Far Cry 2 in 2008.Currently, the developers are working on Assassin's Creed III, Far Cry 3, and Rainbow Six: Patriots game.

Their work in this field includes bringing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and Halo: Combat Evolved to the PC.Gearbox's first original game was Brothers In Arms: Road To Hill 30, released in 2005. Soon after, the sequel-- Brothers In Arms: Earned In Blood--was released. Both games received very positive awards and went on to not only top sales charts but win multiple awards. The games were especially praised for the squad based gameplay and historical accuracy. Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway was released a few years later in 2008.Yep, Duke Nukem will NOT go down without a fight!Sometime before PAX Prime 2010, Kotaku received information from anonymous sources that Gearbox was in control of Duke Nukem Forever. When questioned about this, Randy Pitchford (President of Gearbox) declined to confirm or deny the legitimacy of the reports, instead promising to clarify things at PAX. And clarify they did. Gearbox not only officially announced the game with a presentation by Randy Pitchford but also gave attendees the chance to play a demo of the game.Main Article: Brothers In ArmsMatt Baker, the main protagonist of the Brothers In Arm seriesUnlike many World War II-based shooters, the Brothers In Arms series focuses heavily on squad based gameplay and storytelling. In the first game as well as the third players take on the role of Sergeant Matt Baker and experience his time in the war. The second main game in the series focuses on Joe \"Red\" Hartsock's experiences. What makes this point of view interesting is that Hartsock was one of Baker's squad mates. Some missions in the second game are actually from the first game, but you experience them from a different perspective.During the game, players are in control of two or three teams and can order them around and give orders. Two basic commands--Fall-in and hold position--are used in conjunction with the ability to direct teams to different spots on the map. By aiming at a group of enemies, players can order specific teams to attack them. The third game in the series, Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway, introduced heavy weapon teams like the bazooka team and machine gun team.The latest entry in the Brothers In Arms series was announced at E3 2011. Called Brothers In Arms: Furious Four, the game takes a less serious approach to World War II and features four playable and unique protagonists.Gearbox has also developed games in the series for mobile devices, including one for the iPhone.Main Article: BorderlandsBorderlands is set on the hostile planet of PandoraBorderlands was announced in 2007 but wasn't released until 2009. This was in part due to the massive change in visual styles; originally the game had realistic visuals like many shooters, but one day members of the team came up with the idea to make the game with a cel-shaded style and it stuck with Randy Pitchford. Borderlands now sports a comic book style of graphics.Borderlands is noted for its \"bazillions\" of guns. Guns were procedurally generated based on different statistics and factors like the type of gun barrel, overall damage, accuracy, scope, manufacturer, and more. As a result, it's unlikely that players will find the same gun twice in the game. The game also allows player to get online and experience the game with up to three other people.Before a sequel to Borderlands had been announced, the creative director for the game, Mike Neumann, said a sequel \"seems like a no-brainer\" in an interview with VG247. Borderlands 2 was officially announced on August 3, 2011, and is expected to be released in 2012.Brothers in Arms - Furious 4 (Announced at E3 2011)Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999)Half-Life: Counter-Strike (2000)Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001)Half-Life: Playstation 2 (2001)Half-Life: Platinum Pack (2002)Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (2002)007: NightFire (2002)Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (2003)Halo: Combat Evolved (2003) [PC port, co-developer]Brothers In Arms: Road to Hill 30 (2005)Brothers In Arms: Earned in Blood (2005)Brothers In Arms: D-Day (2006)Brothers In Arms: DS (2007)Brothers In Arms: Double Time (2008)Samba de Amigo (2008)Brothers In Arms: Hells Highway (2008)Borderlands (2009)Duke Nukem Forever (2011)Borderlands 2 (2012)Aliens: Colonial Marines (2013)",

    "description": "Tiger Electronics was founded by Randy Rissman and Roger Shiffman in 1978. There original focus was on handheld electronic games and various toys with a teaching purpose. They later created 2 handheld cartridge systems that both failed to make a real impact on the market. After Tiger's failed attempts at video games they went back to the electronic toy market and are now part of Hasbro.The R-Zone was Tiger's first attempt at a handheld cartridge system seeing three variations between 1995-1997. The systems implemented LCD technology with the Head Gear edition resembling Nintendo's Vitual Boy, though the system was not built with competition in mind. All R-Zone games were reworked variations of existing Tiger handheld games.The Game.com, pronounced game com, was Tiger's second and final attempt at a handheld cartridge system. Unlike the R-Zone, this handheld was built to directly compete against Nintendo's Game Boy. While also a commercial flop with only 20 games ever released, the system was the first to incorporate many features taken for granted today, including PDA-like features, a touch screen, a stylus, internet connectivity and the ability to insert 2 cartridges at once.Batman & RobinCentipedeDuke Nukem 3DFighters MegamixFroggerHenryIndy 500Jeopardy!Lights Out (pack in with new console)The Lost World: Jurassic ParkMonopolyMortal Kombat TrilogyQuiz Wiz: Cyber TriviaResident Evil 2ScrabbleSonic JamTiger Casino (pack in with new console)Wheel of FortuneWheel of Fortune 2Williams Arcade ClassicsA Bug's LifeCastlevania: Symphony of the NightFurbylandMetal Gear SolidNBA HangtimeShadow Madness (while never officially announced, it was seen in a commercial for the system)",

Sound designer/composer Gustaf Grefberg was onboard the company more or less from the start, as both Högdahl and Grefberg were part of the demo group Triton Productions, who had attempted to make the game Into the Shadows, which was cancelled in 1996. Their first project as Starbreeze was developed under the name Sorcery, a first person fantasy role playing game that never saw the light of day.In 2001 Starbreeze merged with the O3 Games and the staff of Starbreeze was moved to Uppsala, Sweden. The Sorcery project was also cancelled around this time and work on their debut title, Enclave, began.Since the merger in 2001, Starbreeze has developed 5 published titles to date with more on the way. With their latest titles being The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, a remake of their critically acclaimed 2004 release The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay with updated visuals, a new single player campaign, and new multiplayer content for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.On 2nd February, 2009, a CEO from the Ludlum Estate confirmed in an interview with Variety that Starbreeze were working on a new Jason Bourne game, following EA's 10 year deal to produce video games based on the works of Bourne author Robert Ludlum.In March 2010 - rumors regarding a cancellation of the Bourne game started appearing, and the only known confirmation is that Starbreeze has confirmed that one of their projects with EA as a publishing partner has been cancelled. The other project Starbreeze was working on - Project Redlime - was rumoured to be a reboot of the Syndicate franchise, which was confirmed following its official announcement in September 2011.Their reboot of the Syndicate franchise was released on Feb. 21, 2012.On April 12 2012, Starbreeze announced that they would be buying the Swedish game development company Overkill Software by acquiring all shares of SLG Ever Screen.",

    "description": "Founded in 1997 by CEO Alex Garden and Luke Moloney, Relic began as a small startup in Vancouver, British Columbia. Garden bankrolled the first year of development on his credit card, until Sierra Entertainment were introduced to their Homeworld project in April of 1998 and agreed to finance the game's development. With the new financial backing, Relic immediately shifted from their old 1600 sq foot office to a much larger 12,000 sq foot facility in Vancouver's historic Yaletown district and expanded by hiring Curtis Terry as CFO and Ron Moravek as COO.Homeworld was the first fully 3-dimensional RTS.After glowing previews at E3 the preview year, Homeworld was released in 1999 and earned several awards, including the prestigious \"Game of the Year\" award from PC Gamer and IGN. The game was universally lauded for its innovative, fully 3-dimensional gameplay and large, cinematic space battles. It was also scientifically proven to be better than pants. A Homeworld spin-off, Cataclysm, was developed by Barking Dog Studios using the same engine and got an equally good critical reception.In December 1999, Relic started working on their next project, titled Sigma: The Adventures of Rex Chance which was eventually renamed and released as Impossible Creatures by Microsoft in December 2002. An RTS at its core, players can collect and combine various animal DNA to design their own units and armies. Relic also started work on an action adventure title in the same universe but it was cancelled due to the game's disappointing sales and critical reception.Relic's next release was the sequel Homeworld 2 in 2003, with various graphical and gameplay enhancements. Though one of the most anticipated RTS titles that year, the final game didn't receive the same level of praise as the original and many reviewers cited a lack of significant evolution over the first as its main drawback. Later in 2003, Relic released the source code to the original and also continued supporting the mod community through their Relic Developer Network.Dawn of War shifted the focus from resource management to combat.Relic entered a multi-property publishing agreement with THQ in April 2003 and soon announced that they were working on Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War, an RTS based on Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 IP. A year later in April 2004, THQ acquired Relic for close to $10 million in an all cash agreement. In October 2004, Relic crossed the 100 employees mark.Dawn of War was released on September 20, 2004 to commercial and critical success. It innovated on the old RTS formula by cutting down on resource management, instead focusing on smaller but more powerful squad-based armies. The game was also very popular among Warhammer fans for a faithful translation of the popular franchise. Relic built on its success and developed the expansion Winter Assault, adding the Imperial Guard faction in the mix. They also released & regularly updated a mod toolset, continuing their strong support of the mod community.In 2006, the standalone expansion Dark Crusade was released and it introduced the Tau and Necron races to the series, in addition to a tactical turn-based mechanic for the main campaign. With over 4 million sales (including the expansion packs), Dawn of War remains one of the highest selling PC games of all time. Also in 2006, Relic made their first foray into console gaming with the The Outfit for the Xbox 360. The game tried to mix squad based strategies with third person shooting but received an average critical reception.Relic's WW-II RTS won them the 'Developer of the Year' award in 2006.Using their new Essence Engine, Relic released the World War II-themed RTS Company of Heroes on Sept 11, 2006. It took the squad based mechanics from Dawn of War even further by adding additional cover mechanics and advanced physics for destructible environments. It was also one of the first games to fully integrate DirectX 10 and featured HDR and dynamic lighting. Company of Heroes' innovative gameplay & engaging main campaign won it several awards and Relic were named the 'Developer of the Year' by IGN that year.Relic iterated on the successful formula with two standalone expansions, Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor over the next three years. They also started work on an micro-transaction based MMO Company of Heroes Online in South Korea, but the servers were shut down after the Beta phase.Relic's next release was 2009's Dawn of War II, which took big risks by having a more RPG-esque single player campaign. Players took control of a handful of space marines and slowly built them using talent trees and item drops. It also took several cues from the Company of Heroes series by making cover & positioning more significant during combat. The game earned mostly positive reviews, with most players praising the fast paced combat but also criticizing the lack of mission variety and multiplayer maps. An expansion, Chaos Rising, was released a year later which further built on the story & mechanics of the original, while also adding the popular Last Stand mode - a horde-mode equivalent for Warhammer champions.In 2011, Relic released the standalone expansion Dawn of War II: Retribution which introduced 6 playable races for the single player campaign and replaced GFWL matchmaking with Steamworks for multiplayer. They also released a standalone game for Last Stand, appropriately named Last Standalone on Steam.Relic's next release, Space Marine was their second go at console games, this time set in the Warhammer universe. Players took control of Ultramarine Captain Titus as he repeled an Ork invasion on a Forge World. Mixing third-person shooting and melee, the game was praised for its combat and but was criticized for a lack of variety in environments and its linear campaign.Relic is currently working on Dawn of War III, with plans of introducing fully customizable units in the single player campaign.Sonic donning Space Marine armor drawn in Relic's kitchen blackboard.On January 23, 2013 in a THQ property auction, Relic was acquired by Sega for $26.6 million.The company's first release under Sega was Company of Heroes 2.",

Their next release was Super Mario Strikers, a well-received Mario-themed soccer game for the Gamecube, followed by a Wii sequel in 2007 called Mario Strikers Charged. Later that same year, they released their next multi-platform title, the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and Wii versions of Spider-Man: Friend or Foe for Activision, which was released to largely mediocre reviews. Their latest release is a Wii remake of the classic NES title Punch-Out!! which was better received. It was announced during a Nintendo developer roundtable at E3 2011 that Next Level was working on Luigi's Mansion 2 for the Nintendo 3DS, later renamed Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. The game would not be released until 2013.Punch Out!! for the WiiNext Level Games has a good reputation as an employer; in 2008, they were named one of Canada's \"Top 100 Employers\" by Mediacorp Canada.",

As the Vice President of KCEJ, Kojima often found himself bogged down with administrative responsibilities and buissness management of the company which enforced major restrictions upon his ability to focus upon games under his development. Taking control over his own Production company allowed Kojima to focus extensively upon the games themselves and allowing him much freedom in terms of how he approaches his work.Technically, Kojima Productions has been a squad of designers led by Kojima ever since 1987, although it was only in 2005 that there was any official title given to the group which came about after the aforementioned merging. Although Kojima Productions is a self serving company, they still often rely upon Konami as a publisher.In 2005, Kojima Productions had approximately 100 working staff, but with the development of Metal Gear Solid 4, the number steadily doubled to 200.Konami Productions is located in Roppongi Hills in Roppongi, Tokyo and it's logo is the FOX badge from Metal Gear Solid 3, a game released shortly before the merger was announced.As of April 1st 2015, Kojima Productions is no longer called that by name as it was folded into Konami proper as part of a company-wide restructuring.",

    "description": "Double Fine Productions began life in July 2000 when it was birthed by veteran game designer Tim Schafer following his departure from LucasArts, where he was well known for his work on several popular adventure games, such as The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango and Day of the Tentacle. The company recruited many of Schafer 's former colleagues from his previous projects.Their first released title was Psychonauts. Although the game was well-received by critics, it sold rather poorly (roughly 120,000 copies) as a result of limited marketing from Majesco and a small budget. The game was regarded by many as a cult hit and earned the young company a dedicated fanbase.Brütal Legend, Double Fine's second title, was released on October 19th, 2009. The new title had a comparatively huge marketing campaign thanks to financing from publisher EA, being plugged at MTV's 2009 Video Music Awards and sponsoring the winning team at the 2009 Red Bull Soapbox Race. The game was generally well reviewed by critics, with a Metacritic rating of 82 on Xbox 360, and a rating of 83 on the Playstation 3. The game sold much better than Psychonauts, selling 1.1 million copies across all platforms.Unfortunately, because of the fairly high cost to produce the game, Brütal Legend's 1.1 million copies were still somewhat disappointing. As a reaction to the relatively low payoff for such a big-budget project, Double Fine announced in August of 2010 that going forward they would develop multiple smaller games concurrently for eventual digital release on consoles.Tim Schafer said that the target would be to work on four games at any given time, with one being a major retail release, and three being smaller download-only projects.The first downloadable game announced was Costume Quest, helmed by former Brütal Legend lead-animator Tasha Harris. The game is the first by Double Fine to be created for digital release, as well as the first project at Double Fine led by someone other than Tim Schafer.While everyone at Double Fine helps create their download-only games, the majority of work on each project is done by relatively small teams within Double Fine, so that multiple projects can be in production at once. This differs from Psychonauts and Brütal Legend, which both involved the entirety of the developer for the full length of the projects.In late September 2010 it was revealed that Double Fine had hired Tim Schafer's long-time friend and former colleague Ron Gilbert to lead development on a new downloadable game. Like Schafer, Gilbert made his name creating visually unique, humorous, character-driven adventure games (with both men working together on the first two Monkey Island games).Double Fine revealed their second downloadable title, Stacking, on November 23, 2010. Stacking is a puzzle game featuring characters that look a lot like Russian matroshka dolls, and set in the 1930s.The third downloadable title by Double Fine, Trenched, was released on June 22, 2011. It features a mix of mech combat and tower defense style gameplay.On February 8th 2012, Double Fine announced a new, untitled adventure game that would be funded on Kickstarter. Schafer stated it as a way to remove publishers from helping fund the game as the adventure game genre is all but dead. Instead, Schafer hopes that enough fans of old school adventures games will rally enough money to get the new game funded. The project met its $400,000 budget in approximately 8 hours and within 24 hours would become Kickstarters fastest growing and highest funded project to date. This game would later be named Broken Age.2005 “Best Action / Adventure Game” for Psychonauts from Official XBOX Magazine2005 “Game of the Year” for Psychonauts from Eurogamer2006 \"Best New Studio\" for Double Fine Productions, Inc., from the Game Developers Conference2009 \"Best Strategy / Simulation Game\" for Brütal Legend from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences2009 \"Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack\" for Brütal Legend from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences2011 \"Developer of the Year\" from Official XBOX MagazineDouble Fine Presents is the company's publishing initiative where they partner with other independent developers to offer advice, marketing and assistance in bringing their game to release. The developers retain control of their IP.Escape Goat 2 Last LifeMountainGang Beasts The name for the company was selected by Tim Schafer after seeing a sign on the Golden Gate Bridge that read “Slow to 45 mph – Double Fine Zone.” He hoped passers-by would read the sign as a declaration that the zone beyond (San Francisco) belonged to his production studio. Unfortunately, the sign has been replaced and no longer features any mention of a \"Double Fine.\"Double Fine Action News is the name of Double Fine's blog. It is written by Tim Schafer and generally acts as his personal blog rather than a marketing outlet. (For example: multiple posts are devoted to an ordeal involving Schafer's discovery of a weevil in his Kashi Instant Oatmeal.) The header image changes periodically and generally features one image mirrored to create two.Double Fine Action Comics are seven web comics created by five Double Fine artists and one senior producer, hosted on the official Double Fine website. Artists Scott Campbell, Nathan Stapley, Mark Hamer, and Tasha Harris each have their own unique series, while Razmig \"Raz\" Mavlian has two. Gabe Miller, the senior producer at Double Fine, is the most recent addition to the lineup.Currently, Scott Campbell, Nathan Stapley, Tasha Harris, and Gabe Miller add new comics once or twice every week or so. Scott Campbell's comic has over 700 entries so far, Nathan Stapley's has over 400, and Tasha Harris's comic has well over 200 submissions.In the summer of 2009, Scott C.'s first 300 comic strips were compiled into Double Fine Action Comics, Vol. 1, a book sold through the Double Fine Shop.The official Double Fine website also hosts the Double Fine Shop. The Double Fine Shop sells many exclusive items related to both Double Fine games and Double Fine Action Comics. Of particular note are various items hand signed by Tim Schafer.The mascot featured in the studio's logo is known as 2-Headed Baby, often shortened by employees and fans to \"2HB.\"Psychonauts is almost always referred to as \"Excellent Game Psychonauts\" throughout the Double Fine website.",

Radical Entertainment went on develop such games as The Simpsons Road Rage, The Simpsons Hit & Run, Hulk, Tetris World, Mario is Missing!, and more until 2005, when they were acquired by Vivendi Games as part of Sierra Entertainment. Radical developed their first game as part of Sierra later that year, Crash Tag Team Racing, taking over the Crash Bandicoot series from Vicarious Visions.

The World Is Yours received a fairly favorable reaction from critics and was a huge success, selling over 2.5 million copies to date. The next year, Radical released their first true entry in the Crash Bandicoot series, Crash of the Titans, the game received a rather lukewarm reaction.

    "description": "Although many people have recently started hearing of WayForward thanks to games like Contra 4 and Aliens Infestation, the company was actually founded in 1990, with the primary goal of developing games for the Super Nintendo and Genesis. Soon after starting the company, they began to branch out into educational games for the PC as well. This side of their business quickly took off, and soon they had signed a deal with American Education Publishing to produce more of these games, largely focusing on licensed properties that children would recognize. The company was recognized with awards for innovation at CES, and because of this success they were able to continue down the same path, focusing on properties such as The Muppets for their educational games and more mature properties such as The Scorpion King for their core games.A screen from Shantae on the GBCBy hiring their services out to other publishers and developers, WayForward were able to keep up a steady workflow even when they didn't have any projects that they were working on internally. Finally, in 2002, WayForward released their own IP for the Game Boy Color called Shantae. The platformer received all round critical acclaim but the Game Boy Color was at the end of its life and was being replaced at stores in favor of the newer Game Boy Advance, which resulted in poor sales for the title. WayForward continued to work on licensed games for the following few years, using the income generated to compensate for the lack of consumer interest in Shantae.Years later, when Nintendo announced their new DS handheld, WayForward began to think about revisiting Shantae. They created numerous assets for the game, but couldn't secure a publisher. All of the assets created for the new game were rendered useless; they can often be seen in the test builds of many of WayForward's other games from the time, used as placeholder art until the final artwork is done. Again, recuperating from the rejection of their IP, the company continued to take on licensed titles. THQ contacted them in 2004 to make a chat-based game for the DS called Ping Pals, which would function much like the DS's built-in Pictochat but with new features and avatars. WayForward accepted, if only to aquire some DS dev kits, and rushed the \"game\" out to a harsh critical reception.After this initial blunder, WayForward went on to create some surprisingly well-received licensed games. They first developed and produced Justice League Heroes: The Flash for the GBA in 2006 as the platform began to die out. The game was met with mostly positive reviews. Following that came Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck for the DS, which was met with average review scores. Their big break came in the form of Contra 4 for the DS, though. Seeing the studio's success on handheld platforms, Konami hired them to create a new 2D Contra game for Nintendo's successful new platform. Upon its release it 2007, Contra 4 was showered with positive reviews and WayForward was thrust into the spotlight.A Boy and His Blob for the Nintendo WiiSince then, they've become famous amongst fans of 2D gaming, particularly platformers, for their gorgeous 2D animations and smooth gameplay. They continued to take on licensed properties, developing handheld versions of games such as Where The Wild Things Are and Batman: The Brave And The Bold, but their work began to take on a more consistant level of quality. WayForward games are almost exclusively in 2D, and are renowned for their crisp and fluid animations. In 2009 they were hired to revamp A Boy and His Blob, which was then released for the Nintendo Wii. The game was praised for its fantastic artwork, reminiscent of a weekend cartoon. Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis said that it was 'a charming all-ages affair that one ups the game it's based on in virtually every conceivable way.' In his review and awarded it 4/5 stars.Since then, they've developed Bloodrayne Betrayal for XBLA and PSN, and Aliens Infestation for the DS. The former, like A Boy and His Blob, garnered much of its attention for its stunning 2D graphics, while the latter, still impressive looking on the DS, has received praised for its resemblance to Nintendo's beloved Metroid franchise, as well as its stringent use of lives. Between Bloodrayne, Contra 4, and Aliens Infestation, many have said WayForward has begun to garner a reputation for crafting difficult games in the style of older NES or SNES games. This would be a fair comparison, as clearly the company has a certain fondness for the era in which they started working with games.Thanks to the advent of downloadable games, and marketplaces such as Nintendo's DSiWare, WayForward was finally able to give their original IP Shantae new life. In 2010, WayForward finally released the Shantae game they had been dreaming of making since the DS was announced: Shantae: Risky's Revenge. The low cost of publishing on DSiWare allowed the company to put the game out without worrying about low sales figures or unreceptive publishers. Like it predecessor, the game was released to widespread critical acclaim, continuing the developer's trend of highly regarded platformers. In 2011, the company later went on to release Shantae: Risky's Revenge on the iOS market. The interface and controls were updated to work better with apple devices.In March 2012, Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time, announced he would be working with WayForward to develop a Nintendo DS game based on the show.",

The developer was a merge between 3 separate Dutch developers including Orange Games and Digital Infinity. They focused on developing games for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. The four games Lost Boys Games developed are: Tiny Toon Adventures: Dizzy's Candy Quest (2001), Rhino Rumble (2002), Black Belt Challange (2002) and Invader (2002).In 2003, Lost Boys Games was sold to Media Republic, a media venture owned by Lost Boys' founder Michiel Mol. In July of 2003 it was renamed to it's current: Guerilla Games. It began development on Killzone (Sony Computer Entertainment, PS2) and Shellshock: Nam '67 (Eidos Interactive, PS2, PC & Xbox). Both games were released in 2004. Shellshock sold over 900.000 copies but recieved bad review scores. Killzone went to sell over a million copies worldwide causing it to recieve a lot of media coverage. Thanks to the succes, Guerilla Games made an agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment for future development of the Killzone franchise exclusively for Sony platforms.In December 2005, Sony Computer Entertainment announced the acquisition of Guerilla Games from parent company Media Republic, making it a wholly owned first party studio. Gueriila Games has since than released three more games: Killzone Liberation, Killzone 2 and Killzone 3. Currently it is working on Killzone: Shadow Fall (which will be an exclusive launch title for the Playstation 4), as well as a new IP unrelated to the Killzone franchise.Currently, the company employs 130 developers, designers and artists from 20 different nationalities, and is led by Managing Director Hermen Hulst.

    "description": "RockSteady Sudios Ltd. is a studio based in North London founded on December 13, 2004. The first game was Urban Chaos: Riot Response which wasn't very well received by critics. The game was released in May 2006 to average reviews and moderate sales. Their second game, Batman: Arkham Asylum, was released in August 2009 to rave reviews, with a sequel, Batman: Arkham City, released in 2011.Rocksteady was founded in 2004 by industry veterans Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker. In just two short years their debut game, Urban Chaos, was released for the PS2 and original Xbox platforms. Published by Eidos Interactive, this first person shooter was given average ratings because it was said to be repetitive while not breaking any new ground in the genre.For their next project, Rocksteady chose to tackle a video game version of Batman using the license from the DC comic books. With their publisher Eidos Interactive in financial trouble and the bleak history of Batman video games in the past, this news was met with some skepticism. An article in the magazine Game Informer shortly afterwords got fans and critics excited with this bold, new look for a Batman game. News steadily trickled out of the studio from their website and the gaming press on the game's progress throughout the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.Early in 2009 it was revealed that cash strapped publisher Eidos was to be acquired by Japanese publisher Square Enix. Rocksteady assured everyone that Batman was on schedule for its targeted release date of June 23, 2009. However, at the E3 event in May, the news that Batman would be delayed until \"later this summer\" was revealed. Rocksteady kept the buzz alive surrounding Batman with a steady stream of new gameplay videos on its official website along with screenshots and team interviews elsewhere on the web. Batman was finally released on its new scheduled date of August 23, 2009. The game so far has received high marks from all reviewers giving Rocksteady much deserved credit for a great rebirth of the Batman franchise in video games, similar to what Christopher Nolan's films have done for the Batman movies.On December 12, 2009, at the Spike Video Game Awards, Batman: Arkham City was teased to open the show. The trailer showed a disheveled Joker receiving a blood transfusion, and Harley Quinn along with numerous other henchman trashing Gotham City.During the Spike Video Game Awards, Rocksteady was named Studio of the Year.Warner Bros. acquired Rocksteady Studios in February 2010.Rocksteady currently has 90 employees.",

    "description": "Factor 5 began when five employees of a German games company, Rainbow Arts, left to form their own studio, headquartered in Cologne, Germany. While in Germany, Factor 5 developed numerous games from the Turrican series for the Atari ST, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Factor 5 moved to San Rafeal, California in 1994 and around that time established relationships with Nintendo, becoming a 2nd party developer, and Lucas Arts, frequently making games based on their licenses. In addition to developing full games, Factor 5 also developed games technologies like MusyX: Dolby Sound Tools and DivX For Games SDK.In 1998, Factor 5 released Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, arguably their most popular game, becoming one of the best selling games for the Nintendo 64. In 2000, they developed two more games based on Lucas Arts properties, Star Wars: Battle for Naboo and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, both for the N64.With the launch of the Nintendo Gamecube in 2001, Factor 5 released a sequel to Rogue Squadron, Star Wars Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader, which was the 2nd best selling title at launch. In 2003, Factor 5 released their last to date, Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike.Factor 5 left Nintendo at the end of that console generation and began an exclusive relationship with Sony for their upcoming Playstation 3. Their first and only game released together is 2007's Lair, which was received negatively by critics and sold poorly on release due to its imprecise controls and numerous technical issues.The critical and commercial failure of Lair, as well as the dissolution of Brash Entertainment (for whom Factor 5 was developing a game based on Superman), put Factor 5 in financial trouble. In May 2009 it was announced that the developer had officially closed its doors and the company is currently in a lawsuit with former employees regarding the company's inability to pay them in its final months.",

Following the merger with Renesas, the company became Renesas Electronics and is currently ranked #5 in the world as of 2011. The company was also known as NEC Technologies.In the video game industry, NEC is best known for the following contributions:The NEC µPD7720, the first commercial DSP (digital signal processor), released in 1980. It was later used as an enhancement chip in SNES game cartridges such as Pilotwings and Super Mario Kart in the early 90's.The 8-bit PC-88 and 16/32-bit PC-98 home computers, launched in 1981 and 1982, respectively. The PC-88 was the first home computer with a high-resolution (640x400) display mode. The PC-98 was one of the best-selling computers of the 20th century, having sold over 18 million units in Japan by the late 90's, rivalling the Commodore 64's ~17 million worldwide sales.The NEC µPD7220 graphics chipset, the world's first computer GPU (graphics processing unit), originally released for the PC-98 in 1982.The PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16 console, which started the 16-bit era of console gaming. It was the first console with dual 16-bit GPU graphics processors and, more importantly, the first home gaming system with CD-ROM support, via the PC Engine CD-ROM / TurboGrafx-CD peripheral. It was very successful in Japan, but was unsuccessful overseas.The PC Engine's 32-bit successor, the PC-FX console, was nowhere near as successful as its predecessor, largely due to its limited 3D graphical capabilities compared to its 32-bit systems, the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.Some of the first 3D graphics accelerator cards, including the PC-FXGA for the PC-98 in 1995 and particularly the PowerVR for the PC in early 1996; these were the most powerful computer graphics cards when they first released in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The PC-FXGA's polygon rendering performance exceeded the PlayStation and rivaled the Nintendo 64, while the PowerVR was able to handle a near arcade quality port of Namco's Rave Racer (though this PC port was later cancelled).

While they primarily focused on the arcades, several of their games would make the trek to consoles. The most famous (well, infamous) of these is Zero Wing, which introduced some wonderfully-translated story sequences at the start and end of the game...Internally, Toaplan were allegedly pretty madcap - an internal newsletter called A Tolanp (Japanese pronounciation of \"A Trump\") was published for employees to check in on the development efforts of other teams, employees were hired in large groups to effectively form new development teams in one shot, and company-wide meetings were high-energy affairs where bad ideas were potentially punished with food fights or shouting matches.Toaplan shut its doors in 1994, declaring bankruptcy. Many reasons have been suggested, ranging from the intense difficulty of their later output, an exodus of senior staff to form Tamsoft in 1992, the release of Street Fighter II and subsequent fighting game boom... whatever the reasons, the staff formed many of their own studios, keeping the company's spirit at least partially alive: Cave8ing/Raizing GazelleTakumi ",

    "description": "Sony is a massive technology and media corporation with numerous sub-divisions going toe to toe with a variety of competitors from Universal Music Group and and EMI, Viacom and Disney, Microsoft and Nintendo, Philips and Samsung, to Dell and Apple.From the start, Sony was on the cutting edge of technology, delivering best selling transistor radios and other gadgets to post war Japan. Its exports grew to become commercially successful, and by the 1970's Sony was a household name in America.The groundbreaking Walkman brand shaped the music industry of the 1980's, and in the 90's, Sony reluctantly took a bite out of the potentially unprofitable fad of video games, and in turn created their most important product for video game consumers: PlayStation.Sony Computer Entertainment is now one of the biggest players in the games industry and is also one of the current \"Big Three\" console manufacturers, alongside Nintendo and Microsoft.The company got its foot in the door to the business with the Playstation 1, creating a strong, recognizable brand that attracted much of the third-party support Nintendo and Sega enjoyed in previous generations, as well as being the top-selling home console of the generation. With the Playstation 2, their success skyrocketed to new heights, being hailed as the highest selling console in history. Its current generation console, the PS3, currently faces tough competition from the Xbox 360 and the Wii.Sony is notable for creating a competitor to Nintendo's strong grip on the portable console market, creating the Playstation Portable.The immense success of the PS family of products within Sony at large has led to promotions of execs handling the PlayStation brand to overseeing the entire consumer electronics division. In 2013, it is expected that E3 press conference favorite Kaz Hirai will take the reigns as Chair, President, and CEO of Sony at large.One of Sony's trademark ways of doing business in tech is to establish its own proprietary formats that rival the joint ventures of its competitors, and giving its own endeavors a significantly higher push in spite of consumer trends. This ensures Sony a better say on anything it puts its name on, in addition to extra royalty fees from the likes of its blu-ray format. This hotheadedness played a part in the PS1 becoming more than just a Super Nintendo add-on, but also the reason why the XMB will still bother CD ripping PS3 owners about ATRAC3 settings.",

Though the team has made occasional forays into console and PC development, the studio has, since its inception, primarily focused on developing handheld games, beginning on Game Boy Color, moving over to Game Boy Advance and finally, after becoming a Rockstar subsidiary, developing for the Nintendo DS, PSP and iOS.In 2003, the studio, based on their work on isometric third-person shooter A Sound of Thunder (based on the Ray Bradbury story and 2005 film of the same name), was contracted by Rockstar Games to develop a Game Boy Advance port of Max Payne to be released alongside its sequel, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. Mobius Entertainment completely rebuilt the game using the same engine as A Sound of Thunder; ironically, however, A Sound of Thunder was released after Max Payne due to the film being delayed for years past its intended 2002 release. The port was critically lauded for retaining most of the elements and charm of its predecessors, including all the graphic novel-style cutscenes and voice acting contained therein. In April 2004, thanks to the success of their Max Payne port, Mobius Entertainment was acquired by Rockstar, changing their name to Rockstar Leeds.As Rockstar Leeds, the team has primarily served as Rockstar's handheld port division. They have also developed all three modern handheld GTA games in partnership with Rockstar North--Liberty City Stories, Vice City Stories and Chinatown Wars--and Beaterator, a handheld music creation utility overseen by music producer Timbaland. Their most recent release was the PC port of Rockstar and Team Bondi's L.A. Noire.",

    "description": "Team ICO (around the development of ICO)Team Ico is a first-party developer founded in 1997, working under Sony Computer Entertainment Japan (SCEJ) in Tokyo. The development team, lead by former artist Fumito Ueda, was largely made up of people outside of the games industry, picked in hopes of creating something unique.While the development team started off small, their size expanded greatly during development of their second game, Shadow of the Colossus.They began proper development of their first game ICO, back in 1998, designed for the original PlayStation. However, due to hardware limitations, it was eventually released on the PlayStation 2 in 2001 to critical acclaim, but it sold poorly.Team ICO then started development of their second title in 2002, eventually becoming Shadow of the Colossus, first released in 2005. The game - much like their previous effort - received a similar critical reception, but sold much better, becoming Japan's top selling game in its first week of release, and selling enough copies to earn a \"Greatest Hits\" release in North America.In February 2007, Team Ico announced a new project for the PlayStation 3 via a full page advertisement in Japanese magazine Famitsu. Almost a year later, the first screenshot for the game was shown via Sony's careers page.In March 2009 at the Game Developers Conference '09, Fumito Ueda stated during a Q&A session that \"it [the new game] might be similar to what's been done\", and \"The essence of the game is rather close to ICO\".On May 19 2009, PlayStationLifestyle.net released several images and a video of the studio's newest project. Tentatively titled Project Trico, the footage began with the scene shown previously in the first image. It showed a boy together with a giant feathered beast traversing vast temple ruins, the architecture similar in style to both ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. It was revealed to be old footage however, shown internally within Sony.On June 1, 2009 the game was officially revealed at Sony's E3 press conference, with the first trailer being shown. It was an updated version of the footage that had been leaked previously, with the scenes slightly edited and now showing a lot more polish, in addition to completely new scenes. The game's title was revealed to be The Last Guardian. Sony Computer Entertainment announced at E3 that The Last Guardian is set for a 2010 release. The year 2010 came and went without any word from Team Ico. By 2013 many people believed that the game was doomed to never come out. This wasn't helped when Jack Trenton stated in an interview that the game was \"on hiatus.\" Team Ico quickly responded, stating that the game was still being actively worked on.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment has been a rising star in the games publishing community, having published such recent hits as Batman Arkham Asylum, Mortal Kombat, and Bastion. But they weren't always such a major player in the industry; in fact, their presence was relatively minor until around 2007.Batman ForeverWarner Bros. Interactive began licensing their properties under their current name around 1995, with the first being Batman Forever, licensed to Acclaim. They continued to license their most popular properties, such as DC Comics, Looney Tunes, and various Cartoon Network shows, as well as movie licenses, to various companies over a stretch of about eight years. While Warner Bros. had little to no involvement in the development of any of these games, it was a quick and easy way for them to make money on their existing properties while handing development over to more experienced industry veterans.Only problem was, these industry veterans were often working under harsh deadlines with little support, and the quality of the products being produced as a result of these deals was suffering greatly. In 2003, Warner Bros. co-published Looney Tunes: Back In Action with EA. It was their first little experiment with video game publishing. In 2004, Warner Bros. acquired Monolith Productions, developers of the FEAR franchise. They were slowly taking a more active role in the games industry, tentatively dipping a toe in the water before jumping in. They wanted to see if it was viable for them to make Warner Bros. a household name in gaming, just as it was in other forms of entertainment.Justice League HeroesUnder Warner Bros.' guidance, Monolith developed The Matrix Online, which was co-published by SEGA. Following the game's release, Warner Bros. continued to seek out new partners in the games industry. They bought a 10.3% stake in SCi Entertainment, the owners of Eidos Interactive, in 2006. Later that year, they published their first game on their own, called Justice League Heroes.By 2007, Warner Bros. had seen that there was, in fact, a substantial market to be had on consoles, and they wanted their name to be as respected in gaming as it was in film. To this end, they announced a five year plan to expand into the gaming industry. They outlined a plan to acquire more game studios, as well as to create their own internal studios in the Seattle area to ensure quality games were developed. They began their expansion with the acquisition of TT Games later that year. TT Games would go on to become an important factor in Warner Bros. growth; they have been developing LEGO games under the Warner banner for years now, beginning with the successful LEGO Star Wars games.In April of 2008, Warner Bros. increased their stake in Eidos, gaining a total of 35% along with rights to distribution of their games in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Later that year, in December, Warner Bros. again increased their stake in the company, making for a total of 10 million shares and also granting Warner Bros. the rights to distribute any new Tomb Raider films that may have been in production. Warner's romance with Eidos wasn't meant to last, though, as Square Enix stepped in during 2009 and slowly gained control of the company, changing their name to Square Enix Europe.Mortal Kombat vs DC UniverseAlso in 2009, Warner Bros. announced that they had acquired Snowblind Studios in an attempt to strengthen their internal development prowess. Later that year, when troubled developer Midway finally went under, Warner Bros. jumped at the opportunity to acquire many of their old assets, including the powerful Mortal Kombat franchise and the then near-completion The Wheelman. Other assets gained included Joust, The Suffering, Blitz: The League, and Spy Hunter, for a total of $49 million, although Warner Bros. has yet to announce anything regarding these properties. Midway had previously worked in conjunction with Warner Bros. on Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, so the MK acquisition was a natural one. In July 2009, Warner Bros. renamed their MK team to WB Games Chicago, later to be changed again to NetherRealm Studios.In August 2009, Warner Bros. and Rocksteady Studios released Batman Arkham Asylum for the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. Due to the stigma associated with licensed games, the industry as a whole was tentatively excited about Arkham Asylum. Its release turned out to be Warner Bros.' biggest hit yet, raking in positive review scores and Game of the Year nominations from dozens of respected sources. Its success was unanticipated and vast. Shortly after, in February 2010, Warner Bros. announced that they had officially acquired Rocksteady Studios as an internal developer.Game Party: In MotionOn March 22, 2010, Warner Bros. announced that they would be opening a new games studio in Quebec, called WB Games Montreal. It has been projected that the studio will grow to over 300 employees by the end of 2015. They are planning on opening another studio in the city soon as well. These Canadian studios will be largely focused on developing games under the DC Comics label. Continuing a long list of acquisitions, Warner Bros. also took Turbine, developer of Dungeons and Dragons Online and Lord of the Rings Online, under their wing. This was quickly followed by the announcement that Turbine's Lord of the Rings Online would go free to play in the fall of 2010. Also in 2010, Warner Bros. announced development of a new Mortal Kombat title for PS3 and 360, and a new FEAR title, both eventually to be released in 2011. Finally, to round out 2010, Warner Bros. released Game Party: In Motion for Microsoft's new Kinect peripheral.2011 is set to be another big year for Warner Bros. Interactive. They released the Mortal Kombat reboot on April 19 to critical acclaim and high sales, especially high for a fighting game. FEAR 3 was released on June 21, and although it received mixed reviews, it was still moderately successful. The company also published Supergiant Games' Bation as part of Microsoft's Summer of Arcade initiative, and this is perhaps their greatest success of 2011 so far. The game received numerous high review scores, averaging an 86 and an 88 on Metacritic for the 360 and PC versions, respectively.Arkham CityOn October 18, 2011, Warner Bros. Interactive released their most anticipated game yet, Batman Arkham City. This game, also developed by Rocksteady Studios, takes Batman out of the confines of the Asylum and into a wide open city teeming with criminal activity.Warner Bros. Interactive is going strong, and they are only becoming more prominent in the game development scene. In mid-2011, they announced another Batman game, this one developed by Monolith. Called Gotham City Impostors, this game will be a squad-based downloadable shooter for consoles. It sees Batman and The Joker inspiring vigilantes across Gotham to take up arms and fight for their respective sides, leading to a bunch of costumed firefights across the city.Once Upon A Monster. It's fun for the whole simulated family!Since Grasshopper Manufacture's relationship with EA's publishing branch fell through with the neutered release of Shadows of the Damned, Warner Bros. Interactive has announced that they will be publishing the company's subsequent games in the North American markets in stead of EA. In the future, Warner Bros. will publish Lollipop Chainsaw with the distinctive developer. Warner will also be working with another acclaimed and unique developer, Double Fine Productions, to create a new Sesame Street game for the Kinect. This game, Sesame Street Once Upon A Monster, was released on October 11, 2011, to generally good reviews despite its status as a children's game.In the future, Warner Bros. Interactive plans on continuing their strong lineup of releases, combining both licensed games based on their TV shows and movies, and original games such as Lollipop Chainsaw, to make for a strong and varied portfolio. Their planned future releases include, as of late 2011, the conclusion to the LEGO Harry Potter series, a sequel to the original Happy Feet game to premiere alongside the movie sequel, The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, and numerous other licensed games. The company anticipates Arkham City to be a great success, and to fuel their continued rise as a prominent game publisher.",

    "description": "DICE is a Swedish-based development company, founded in 1988. In the early years of the company, DICE developed pinball games for the Amiga home computer and multiple racing games. DICE is probably most well known for their Battlefield franchise - Battlefield 1942 being the first game in the franchise.DICE got its start in 1988 as a demo group, The Silents, in the dorm rooms at Växjö University. Its four founding members were Andreas Axelsson, Olof Gustafsson, Ulf Mandorff and Fredrik Liliegren. The company was first registered under the name Digital Illusions HB in May of 1992, which was subsequently changed to its present name Digital Illusions CE AB in Jan. 1993. While still students at the university, they developed popular pinball games for the Amiga: Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies and Pinball Illusions.In 1994, the company expanded sufficiently to warrant opening a new headquarters in Gothenburg. During its early years, DICE produced racing games like S40 Racing, STCC & Motorhead. Then in 1999, they delved into the military shooter genre with Codename Eagle, a game which is often seen as a predecessor to Battlefield series. In 1998, they became a listed company on the Stockholm stock exchange.1942 was DICE's breakthrough gameIn Jan. 2000, they acquired 100% stake in Refraction Games and eventually moved into their previous office in 2005. They also acquired Sandbox Studios in April 2001 and rebranded it to Digital Illusions Canada Inc.In Sep. 2002, Battlefield 1942 was released to commercial & critical success and the game was widely praised for its large scale battles. It cemented DICE's stature, and also led to the highly successful Battlefield franchise.In 2004, DICE also bought Trauma Studios, the developers behind the popular Desert Storm mod for Battlefield 1942. The studio was renamed DICE New York, and helped in the development of Battlefield 2. The team was offered a move to Stockholm to work on Battlefield 2142 but they declined. The studio was eventually discontinued and most of them went on to form Kaos Studios, a former subsidiary of THQ.In 2004, Electronic Arts announced their intent to purchase DICE and bought a 62% stake over the next year. By Oct 2, 2006 their purchase was completed, and DICE became a subsidiary of Electronic Arts. The company name was subsequently changed to EA Digital Illusions CE, though many players still recognize the company as simply DICE.In 2005, the company moved from Gothenburg, to the ex-Refraction Games' studio in Stockholm. This happened shortly before the company was acquired by Electronic Arts. Released in 2008, Mirror's Edge was Digital Illusion's first big project outside the Battlefield franchise with EA.DICE released Battlefield 3 in 2011.DICE is currently working on Battlefield 4, and the Frostbite engine that is utilized by multiple EA studios.From the DICE offices in Stockholm you could see the office of former game developer Grin.During a late night shift, a couple of DICE employees got yelled at by a drunk woman from the floor above them. She was an employee for another company in the same building.DICE is an acronym for 'Digital Illusions Creative Entertainment'.The company's foundation in The Silents is referenced in many of its games. In Motorhead, players can find the logo \"TSL\" - an acronym for the erstwhile demogroup.",

    "description": "Irrational Games was formed in 1997 by Ken Levine, Jonathan Chey, and Robert Fermier. Their first project was the single player campaign for Fireteam, an isometric shooter by Cyro Interactive. However, this proved to be a false start when Cyro decided to concentrate on the multiplayer aspect and dropped Irrational's project.Soon after, Paul Neurath, Head of Looking Glass at the time, contacted them with an opportunity. This eventually led to Irrational's first published product - System Shock 2. The sequel to the much beloved System Shock, was adored by critics for its tense atmosphere, exquisite sound design, and its faithfulness to the original while making drastic improvements. While the critics and fans adored it, the game went largely unnoticed by the larger gaming audience. Ever since, System Shock 2 makes recurring appearances on many \"Greatest Games of All Time\" lists in publications. This reputation for producing high quality, but poorly-selling PC titles would follow Irrational for years, earning them a cult following of fans.Irrational opened a second studio in Canberra, Australia in 1999. Co founder, Jonathan Chey a native Australian and was in charge of the new studio. Irrational Canberra developed their own superhero IP and released the RPG Freedom Force in 2002. The game was an homage to silver-age comic books and received universal critical approval. Their next two major titles were both sequels in disparate genres: Tribes: Vengeance (2004), the final game in the Earthseige sci-fi franchise, and SWAT 4 (2005), a tactical squad-based first-person shooter. In between, they also managed to squeeze in an expansion pack to Freedom Force in Freedom Force vs the Third Reich.With the success of SWAT 4, publisher Vivendi wanted another SWAT game. Creative director Ken Levine didn't want to do another straight forward cop simulator. An existing concept set in the zombie apocalypse that had previously pitched, was then combined with the shooter squad tactics of the SWAT games. Vivendi was willing to go along with the project, but both parties agreed that zombies didn't fit the SWAT franchise. The title of game became Division 9. The project was canceled after the acquisition by Take-Two.On January 9, 2006, Take-Two interactive announced that they had purchased Irrational, and would publish their games under the 2K Games label, 2K Boston and 2k Australia. 2K Boston would use the extensive funding from 2K to begin development on BioShock: a spiritual successor to System Shock 2. In August, 2007, BioShock was released to critical and commercial success far exceeding any of Irrational's prior titles, thanks in large part to 2K's substantial marketing budget and the greater audience exposure that came with releasing on consoles (Xbox 360 and PS3).On December 17th 2007, five members of 2K Boston broke off to form a new studio called 2K Marin, who immediately began work on BioShock's sequel, freeing 2K Boston to begin work on another project. A January 10th, 2010, viewing of programmer Shane Matthews's LinkedIn profile showed his current project as \"Project Icarus\" though his profile was made private shortly thereafter.The new mouthpiece for the folks at IrrationalOn January 8, 2010, 2K Boston announced the return of their previous moniker, Irrational Games. The reason for the renaming was they observed that references made to 2K Boston persistently included \"(formerly Irrational Games)\" which demonstrated the value that the old name still held in people's minds. In celebration of their renaming, Irrational also relaunched their website using the old URL of irrationalgames.com with the goal of using the site to better engage with fans. The site features behind-the-scenes tidbits from old Irrational Titles like System Shock 2, Freedom Force and BioShock as well as insights into the game creation process.In addition, Ken Levine and Co. started a new podcast named Irrational Behavior exploring the ideas and inspirations that make them \"tick\".On March 26th, 2013 Bioshock Infinite (previously known as Project Icarus) was released to massive critical and commercial success. After the team finished working on DLC for the game titled \"Burial at Sea\" (which sees the franchise return to Rapture), Irrational Games closed its doors.Hey Everyone!Some of you might remember us as Irrational Games, the studio that brought you titles such as SWAT 4 and Freedom Force. Our name might have changed but we're still dedicated to creating evolutionary and immersing experiences for gamers.A lot has been happening at our little studio since BioShock launched and we became a part of the 2K family. We can't tell you exactly what we're working on just yet, but when we have some news, we'll announce it here, so stay tuned.2K Boston continues to expand, and we need more creative talent than ever before to help with production. Click in our careers section to see what jobs are currently available, there might be a role to suit you!Thanks for stopping by and we hope you look forward to the announcement of our next big title.In the meantime, check out our PowerPoint Presentation on The Art and Technology Behind BioShock's Special Effects as presented at GDC.-The 2K Boston team",

This venture was meant to bring Sammy into the video games industry, though before the studio could produce a game, it broke away from Sega Sammy during the 2004 Sega and Sammy merger. The San Diego studio renamed themselves High Moon Studios and were quickly acquired by Vivendi Games, which became part of Sierra Entertainment.High Moon Studios released their first game later that year, Darkwatch. However, since development had began prior to High Moon being acquired by Vivendi, the game was published by Capcom in the United States and Ubisoft in the United Kingdom. High Moon's first game developed for Sierra was released in 2008, The Bourne Conspiracy. This was High Moon's first of many planned games based on the Jason Bourne licence, however the license was lost during Activision's acquisition process of Vivendi's assets.High Moon's third game, Transformers: War for Cybertron, was released by Activision on June 22, 2010. High Moon's fourth outing, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, was released on June 14, 2011, and their fifth game, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, a sequel to War for Cybertron, is due for release on August 21, 2012.On July 14th, 2012, it was announced during the San Diego Comic-Con that High Moon was developing a game based on the Marvel character Deadpool, due for release in 2013.",

Irrational Games became 2K Boston and Irrational Canberra became 2K Australia.On April 14, 2010, the usage of the 2K Australia name was dropped and the studio itself has become a sister studio to the 2K Marin studio, also using their label instead.

    "description": "Apple Headquarters Cupertino, CAApple Inc. is an American Corporation known for designing personal electronics married with exclusive software. The company started making personal computers starting with the early success of the Apple II, and later introducing Graphical User Interfaces to the market with the Macintosh and with the Apple Newton, started producing consumer electronics. Although unsuccessful it was considered ahead of it's time, and paved the way for other successful consumer devices like the iPod and the iPhone.The Original Apple IApple was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak who met while working at Atari. They left to start Apple in Steve Jobs' garage and established themselves on April 1, 1976. The Apple I went on sale in July of the same year. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard which contained a CPU, RAM, and a basic chip set. It was originally priced $666.66 and soon after dropped below $500.Apple II was introduced April 16th, 1977 for $1298 with 4 kB of RAM. There where many RAM configurations maxing out at $2638 for 48 kB of RAM. The \"killer app\" of the Apple II was a spreadsheet called Visicalc, and a \"basic\" code compiler. The Apple II was the first computer designed to look more like a home appliance than a computer. Steve Jobs explained that he didn't want the computer toThe Apple IIseem out of place in the home. It obviously wasn't, the Apple II line was a huge success garnering more than a 70% of the home computer market. One of Apple's most notable early competitors was IBM who focused on the business market and didn't target home computers until the early 80s.Steve Jobs could feel the pressure from IBM and other computer manufactures. In December of 1979 Jobs got to preview Xerox's technology by offering them 1 million dollars in stock options. They showed him three things, a digital scanner, a printing method, and the mouse. With that Apple reinvented the typical UI. They essentially traded 1 million dollars in pre-IPO stock for the concept of the Graphical User Interface. Jobs spawned two GUI projects. The expensive powerful Lisa which debuted to shaky economy in 1983 for $9995. With no \"killer app\" it failed. But without having invested into the Lisa, they wouldn't have been able to pull off the Macintosh.The Macintosh.GUI concepts pioneered in Lisa flowed to the Macintosh computer. In 1984 the Macintosh launched bundled with some full featured Apple developed software, and a more aggressive price of $1995. It was a deal for a computer bundled with speakers, a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a magical operating system. Even with Mac paint and Mac draw the Macintosh's true killer apps was the original Microsoft Office, and Lotus Jazz (Lotus 1-2-3 for the mac). Without the support of Microsoft the Macintosh wouldn't have been a success. The eventual down fall of the Macintosh is that is was difficult to program for. You had to use an object oriented programming code like C instead of a linear code like basic. There where more apps on the DOS platform, and was a major marketing point against the Mac.Jobs and SculleySteve Jobs, Apples founder and visionary, lost in a power struggle with, then runner of day to day operations, John Sculley. People believe it was over the enormous amount of resources Jobs was pouring into Research and Development, 3 times that of similar companies. At first with Jobs' absence, Apple flourished. They introduced the portable mac in 1989 for a premium, but followed up with a less expensive round 2 called the Powerbook. Which established the modern form and ergonomic layout of the laptop computer. Mac addict claims that 1989-1991 as Apple's first golden years. However after that Apple began to struggle. Apple was spreading itself too thin with a portable device called the Newton and a home video game system called the Pippin. While spreading itself thin Apple didn't pay attention to the Mac business. The Macintosh line was confusing. They had the Quadra Line of computers, the Centris line, and the Performa line, also a whole range of portable computers. Some Apple computers where shipped with lesser quality components, making some configurations unstable. The Apple operating system evolved but was still difficult to program for. Windows was gaining popularity and offered cheaper hardware options.Mac OS X LeopardThe leadership at Apple also grew shaky with Jobs' departure. John Sculley tarnished the reputation of Apple and was replaced as CEO by Michael Spinder and then again by Gil Amelio, the layoff king. The Mac OS ceased evolving, due to lack of R&D so in 1996 Amelio did the right thing. He purchased NeXT, a company that developed a more advanced operating system, NeXTSTEP. With that acquisition came Steve Jobs, Apple's original CEO. In 1997 Steve Jobs replaced Gil Amelio as CEO. He ended all projects at Apple other than the Mac. He was forced to borrow money for Microsoft to abandon the failed clone project. Steve announced that the war between Microsoft and apple was over. At this moment Apple was not competing to gain market-share, they competed to become profitable.The Original iMacUpon Steve's return to the company the first project he brought to market was the iMac in 1998. An all in one computer reminiscent of the Original Macintosh. It was one of the first computers to ship with a USB, an Ethernet port, Internet Explorer, and an internal modem. The \"i\" was for internet; internet mac became iMac. It was rumored that Steve originally hated the name. This ushered in new life into Apple, simplifying there line into four categories of computers. The iMac and iBooks were for consumer, While the Powerbook (later Macbook Pro) and the G4 tower (later Mac Pro) where for pros. This simplified line exists at Apple today.The Digital HubIn 2001, Apple launched OSX. OSX was a new operating system with better security and memory management. It had a bumpy road at first with slow launching applications, long startup times, and several bugs. However even at it's worst it was considered by some the most advanced operating system available. Casual software was sparse because programming had be done in Objective C. The Pro apps shined, especially video. When Apple released Final Cut Pro, the professional videographer was committed to the Mac. Apple in the first release of OSX included iLife, \"the center of your digital life.\" This suite of apps include today iMovie, iPhoto, Garage Band, iTunes, iWeb (And at that time iDVD) These were apps designed to make the Mac / OSX the hub of your digital life. Connecting your cameras, video cameras, MP3 players, in simple and easy ways. iLife was the Mac's killer app.iPodsLater in 2001 Apple released the iPod. A device that changed the music industry forever. Originally it was a hard drive-based MP3 player about the size of a deck of cards that aloud you to carry 1,000 songs in your pocket. This 5gig player for $499. The players purpose was to offer a mobile version of your iTunes library in a simplified interface using the click wheel. Over time the iPod became more affordable and with more storage. The true mass appeal of the device was with the second generation iPod nano that sold for $199. Before then everyone wanted one, after the $199 nano everyone could afford them. Apple doubled it's annual sales in less than a year. Apple is currently the leader in the MP3 player market with a 65%-80% market share depending on units or dollars.On January 9th 2007, Apple changed the field of consumer electronics again with the release of the iPhone. Apple's \"Jesus phone\" was a smart phone with no buttons, no keyboard just a giant multi touch screen. It made calls, handled email, behaved like an iPod, and it's killer launch app was a full safari browser. It was the internet in your pocket. The phone was exclusive to AT&T and a year later was launched world wide. That same year Apple started the app store, an avenue for third party developers to make applications and distribute them through iTunes. This was a breakthrough moment in cellular computing. Many of these apps are casual games like Plants vs Zombies or zen bound. Consumers have downloaded over 4 billion apps, and the store generates apple over $1billion annually. (Piper Jaffray)In April of 2010, Apple released the iPad. A tablet computer they claim to be magical and revolutionary. It had early success, selling 300,000 in the first day.Apple's story follows very much the life of it's founder Steve Jobs, and his insistence on innovation, secrecy and invention. Upon his first departure from the company Apple struggled to innovate, falling stagnant, almost bankrupt. Steve's return brought life back into Apple creating a more profitable company, filled with exciting products, and a devoted following.",

Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital, the EA Games relocated to a San Mateo office that overlooked the San Francisco Airport landing path. Headcount rose rapidly in 1983, including Don Daglow, Richard Hilleman, Stewart Bonn, David Gardner, and Nancy Fong.February, 1982. Trip Hawkins arranged a business meeting with Don Valentine (Sequoia Capital) to discuss financing his new business enterprise, Amazin’ Software. December 1982, Seven months later. Hawkins secured US$2 million of venture capital from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Sevin Rosen Funds. Between September and November, employee headcount rose to 11, including Tim Mott, Bing Gordon, David Maynard, and Steve Hayes. Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital, the company relocated to a San Mateo office that overlooked the San Francisco Airport landing path. Headcount rose rapidly in 1983, including Don Daglow, Richard Hilleman, Stewart Bonn, David Gardner, and Nancy Fong.In 1983 Hawkins left the company and went on to found the now defunct 3DO corporation.Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers. Combined with the fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands, this made sales growth more challenging. Retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners. Despite this, revenue was $5 million in the first year and $11 million the next Former CEO Larry Probst arrived as Vice President of Sales in November 1984 and helped the company sustain growth into $18 million in its third full year. Teaming with the existing sales staff that included Nancy Smith, David Klein, and David Gardner, Probst built the largest sales force of any American game publisher. This policy of dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better market awareness, key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors.In December 1986 David Gardner and Mark Lewis moved to the UK to open a European headquarters. Up until that point publishing of Electronic Arts Games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in Europe was handled by Ariolasoft. A small company in Wales was already called Electronic Arts, and until 1997 Electronic Arts in the UK was known legally as EOA, a name derived from its square/circle/triangle logo. The Welsh company ceased trading in 1997 and Electronic Arts acquired the rights to the name.An innovative approach to giving credit to its developers was one of EA's distinctive characteristics in its early days. This characterization was even further reinforced with EA's packaging of most of their games in the \"album co pioneered by EA because Hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling EA routinely referred to their developers as \"artists\" and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous full-page magazine ads. EA also shared lavish profits with their developers, which added to their industry appeal. Because of this novel treatment, EA was able to easily attract the best developers and the developers were usually very happy working for EA.EA Games is currently headquartered in the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California. Following the departure of Trip Hawkins, Larry Probst took over the reins and led the company to its current size and stature. Probst considered himself a man of principle and has refused to follow the M-rated example set by Take-Two Interactive, whose violent Grand Theft Auto franchise became the dominant brand in many key demographics from 2000 through 2003. As a result, Probst was heavily criticized by Wall Street analysts, who believe that because of this policy, EA's stock price is lower than it should be.] In late March 2005, Electronic Arts issued its first ever mid-quarter profit warning blaming hardware shortages and lower than expected fourth quarter sales.In 1999 EA approved its first M-rated game, System Shock II for the PC. Probst later changed his overall stance on M-rated games, and now EA has several titles that compete in the M-rated, adult game arena.In 2004, EA made a multimillion dollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. In addition to the funds, EA staff members have been actively teaching and lecturing at the school. In 2009, they purchased Facebook social games developer Playfish, whose games include Pet Society and Restaurant City.

PlatinumGames' first five titles were published by SEGA.In the second half of 2010, Shinji Mikami and a number of other employees left the company to form Tango Gameworks.In early 2008, PlatinumGames announced a four-game deal with SEGA. The first of the games to be released was MadWorld for the Wii, an extremely violent 3D beat 'em up with humor elements. The second was Bayonetta for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, marking Hideki Kamiya's return to the \"stylish action\" genre he pioneered with Devil May Cry. Next was Infinite Space, a Nintendo DS RPG that PlatinumGames produced with development handled by Nude Maker. The fourth game was Vanquish for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a science fiction third-person shooter directed by Shinji Mikami.In January 2011 PlatinumGames announced their final SEGA-published game, Anarchy Reigns (Max Anarchy in Japan), a multiplayer beat 'em up which was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in January 2013. At the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards it was announced that PlatinumGames would be collaborating with Kojima Productions on Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, a third person action game starring Raiden.

They were setting the wheels in motion and getting funding together when Visual Science went into administration, and they began approaching other former colleagues for starting Proper Games. From day one, they enjoyed the benefit of some independent funding, so some time could be taken to get up and running. Initially there were only seven employees, and operated under the delusion they could make a downloadable game in three months. Their first year was essentially spent developing technology and investigating ways to get to market, but had the luxury of making mistakes internally for educational purposes. Over the course of two and a half years grew to twelve full time staff members, two contractors and two student placements. They have now partnered with Capcom to publish their debut, sheep-herding alien puzzler, Flock!., and are looking to develop two to three titles concurrently. They also worked on Final Fight: Double Impact for Capcom, as well as the Downloadable Content for Crackdown 2. The aim at Proper Games is quoted as bringing \"the old school arcade values we all grew up loving to the current generation of consoles using their full capabilities to enhance that most important of qualities - fun!\". They are convinced they want to make different sorts of games to the mass market, and present them on as many different platforms as possible. In the same vein as fellow British developer Media Molecule, they also wish to maintain a culture of no crunch, whilst remaining a small company with no more than 25 people. Sinclair describes an environment where everyone knows everyone and there are \"no huge surprises\".

In April 1998, Sony renamed the studio yet again to its final moniker, 989 Studios. 989 Studios seemed to act as a catch all for Sony and the label was mostly used for publishing, although they developed many titles including most of Sony's sports games as well as Twisted Metal III and 4. 989 Studios is no longer a development house, instead it was merged with Red Zone Games in 2001 around the launch of the PS2, and became SCE Studios San Diego.",

Since The Maw, Twisted Pixel has only created games based on their own intellectual properties using their internal BEARD engine.Twisted Pixel's debut title was The Maw. The title went on to win the PAX 10, as well as many other independent game awards.With titles like Splosion Man and Comic Jumper, Twisted Pixel gained a reputation for strong characters, quirky gameplay, and full motion video integrated into their titles.In 2010, the studio grew to two teams in order to support their next set of titles: Ms. Splosion Man and The Gunstringer. The Gunstringer ended up being the studios first original IP released as a physical product instead of a downloadable title, and was included in the Kinect hardware bundle for the 2011 holidays alongside Kinect Adventures.In October 2011, Microsoft Studios announced it had purchased Twisted Pixel with the intention being to allow the studio to keep its spirit and creativity.",

Noire would turn out to be the first and last game released by Team BondiIn June 2011, several employees from Team Bondi came out to complain about the horrendous working conditions at Team Bondi. According to the sources, employees were forced to work overtime with no additional pay, were lied to about release dates in order to justify the overtime, and were treated poorly by Brendan McNamara. Further, insiders suggested that McNamara's leadership style had led to the company burning their bridges with L.A. Noire publisher Rockstar Games. The notoriously perfectionist publisher had allegedly considered purchasing the studio and bringing its creator more into the fold during the game's development, but development issues and numerous feuds with McNamara led to a fractured relationship in which both studios assumed primary ownership over the game's success.Because of the bad press the company received over poor working conditions, the company was unable to secure a deal to make a new game forcing them to shut down in October 2011.",

The defiant map pack features 3 new maps: Condemned, Highlands, and Unearthed (Firefight).Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary - A high-definition remake of the original Halo, created in conjunction Saber Interactive and Certain Affinity. The game features a graphical overhaul for the single player campaign, and allows the player to switch between old (2001) and new (2011) at any time. 7 multiplayer maps were recreated by Certain Affinity within the Reach engine, which will be updated to support gametypes created to simulate the Halo Combat Evolved multiplayer experience as close as possible. In addition to this, 343 Industries is also including new features such as terminals, that will presumably provide background on the plot for the upcoming Halo 4.

    "description": "Through their publishing of puzzle games over recent years, Nikoli have helped popularize common puzzle types such as Sudoku and Kakuro around the world. However these two particular puzzles were originally developed in America.While appearing in many games, Nikoli puzzles have most extensively appeared in conjunction with Hudson Soft on the DS through their 'Puzzle Series' games, and other titles such as Illustlogic. However, these have not been published outside of Japan.Nikoli have also been responsible for developing several kinds of original puzzles which have appeared in game form, and believe the worldwide success of their puzzles is largely due to their language independence, featuring universal concepts and only numbers, not letters.Some notable example of Nikoli's own puzzle types:SlitherlinkA single loopProbably the most recognised of Nikoli's puzzles, Slitherlink requires the player to draw a path onto a grid filled with various 'number clues'. Numbers indicate the number of sides of that square which form part of the path.The finished pathway has to form a single closed loop. Consequently, the logic of the game involves avoiding a path that splits, reaches a dead end, or forms two or more loops.AkariAll lit up!Also known in the west as Light Up, Akari is one of the simpler puzzle types. Akari starts with a Crossword style grid with several squares blocked out. The aim of the game is to place 'lights' around the grid, which illuminate squares in that row or column, unless blocked by a filled square.Numbers on some squares indicate how many lights should be in the adjacent four squares. A correctly solved puzzle should have all squares lit, and no two lights should illuminate each other.HitoriA finished puzzleLike Sudoku, Hitori is about a square grid full of numbers. However, Hitori is almost the opposite of Sudoku, as it starts with a full grid, and numbers must be removed. The aim of the puzzle is to block out squares, so that no row or column contains more than one of any number.The other conditon of the game is that all remaining numbers should connect to each other (not counting diagonally). Tradtionally, numbers are circled when they are confirmed as required.NurikabeWalls and GroupsConceptually one of Nikoli's more complicated puzzles, Nurikabe is named after a 'wall demon' from Japanese folklore. Playable on a grid of any size, the aim is to use the initial number clues to construct a wall pattern which partitions the remaining squares into groups.The size of each group must equal the number on a square within it. The player must therefore avoid groups which have no number, or more than one number. Similar to Hitori, the 'wall' must exist as one continuous structure, and additionally not contain any 2x2 squares.Other puzzle types featuring in Nikoli publications include Numberlink, Fillomino, Ripple Effect and Hashiwokakero.Nikoli is named after a race horse.",

    "description": "Iron Galaxy Studios is a video game developer based in Chicago, Illinois. Former Midway employee Dave Lang is its CEO.Unlike many other small video game developers, Iron Galaxy Studios has tended to focus more upon creating partnerships with larger videogame studios than it has upon creating its own unique IP. This has enabled it to complete work on parts of much larger projects, that it would have been unable to undertake alone. This all fits within the ambit of its provision of technical consultancy services. Some examples of such partnerships include;Scribblenauts Remix - The iOS version of this Scribblenauts collection was developed by Iron Galaxy Studios working in conjunction with WB and 5th Cell. It features content from previous Scribblenauts games, in addition to some brand new levels exclusive to iOS.Ms. Splosion Man - Iron Galaxy Studios is working on porting this Xbox 360 title to the iOS and Windows Phone 7 formats (working in partnership with Twisted Pixel).Back to the Future: The Game (Wii) - A partnership with Telltale Games enabled Iron Galaxy Studios to work on the port of the Back to the Future title for the Nintendo Wii format.Bioshock 2 (PC) DLC - Iron Galaxy Studios helped to bring The Protector Trials and Minerva's Den DLC to the PC platform, working in partnership with 2K Marin. They also worked on a number of fixes to the original game itself.Killer Instinct (XBOX ONE) - In March 2014 Iron Galaxy's Dave Lang announced that his studio would be taking over development of Killer Instinct after it's original developer, Double Helix was acquired by Amazon earlier in the year.Borderlands 2 (VITA) - Although the developer was not originally announced alongside the project at Sony's 2013 Gamescom press conference, Iron Galaxy ported Borderlands 2 to the Vita, which released to mixed reception.The company is also working on a number of unannounced projects with developers including 2K, Capcom and Epic Games.The company has recently also begun to work on developing its own IP. Its first original title, Wreckateer, was released on 25 July 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade. It is a physics based destruction game which makes use of Xbox Kinect for motion control functionality. The game is set in a medieval fantasy world.

    "description": "Founded in Manchester, England  Ocean Software, also known as Ocean of America in the United States, developed and published games for gaming systems such as ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, PC, and later consoles including Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System and Sega Mega Drive.    Ocean Software began by buying many Television and Movie licenses for their video games, which although were not well received by critics, were huge financial successes. This enabled Ocean Software to fund original game developments and purchase many arcade conversion licenses and make ports for other gaming platforms. Ocean did receive positive reviews for some movie licensed games such as Batman The Movie (1989),  RoboCop (1988), and Robocop 3 (1992), which featured 3D graphics in 16-bit versions.   With the decrease in popularity of the Spectrum and Amiga and the introduction of new console systems such as the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, Ocean Software went through a transition phase getting to grips with the new technology. This lead to fewer titles being developed and subsequently the purchase by Infogrames UK in 1998 in a deal worth $100 million.   Ocean loader introduced the concept of loading screens to 8-bit platform gaming.  Traditionally games would take several minutes to load from cassette with on form of display or sound. This changed when Ocean Loader was first introduced in games for the Commodore 64. Now during loading a picture representing the game was displayed on TV screens while music played in the background. Five versions of background music themes were produced and were composed by different people.  Versions 1 & 2 - Composed by Martin GalwayVersion 3 - Composed by Peter ClakeVersions 4 & 5 - Composed by Jonathan Dunn Ocean Loader was written by in-house games programmer Bill Barna and the first game to implement Ocean Loader coding was Hyper Sports.  From 1987 onwards Ocean Loader was replaced by Freeload written by Paul Hughes.   Founded by David Ward and John Woods, initially called Spectrum Software, Ocean Software began as a publisher hiring many outside programmers and development teams. The companies first releases included Digger Dan, Daley Thompson’s Decathlon, HighNoon, Mr Wimpy: The Hamburger Game and Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge.  Purchased rival software studio, Imagine which was based in Liverpool. This allowed Ocean to start developing in-house games and also enabled self publication of games.  Ocean later struck a deal with Konami to publish their arcade games such as Hypersports, Ping Pong and Kung Fu using the Imagine brand.  RamboOcean began developing and publishing its first Movie licensed games such as Rambo, Short Circuit, Cobra, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, some becoming classics such as Batman, Wizball among many others. The company start developing games for 16-bit computer systems such as Amiga and Atari ST and well as working on gaming platforms like Sega Master System and DOS.   Ocean Software signed a deal with Japanese games developer Taito Corporation to port their arcade classics such as Arkanoid and Renegade on various platforms. Ocean Software continued to grow becoming one to the biggest game publishers during this period.  Robocop Ocean Software were voted ‘Best Software House’ in various computer magazines.  Movie licenses continued to dominate their portfolio with their most successful release Robocop coinciding with the movie premier. This game received critical acclaim by gamers and critics alike entering the game charts at No. 1 and staying there for over 18 months. Ocean continued to produce more movie licensed games (Batman, Rambo III) and arcade conversions ( Operation Wolf) which strengthened their position within the industry. During this year Ocean saw its output grow by 50% and now they were regularly producing games for all major 8-bit and 16-bit  platforms. More successful movie licensed games  followed such as Batman: The Movie featuring cinematic cut scenes.  Ocean were going though a transitional phase focusing on bringing the Television, Movies licenses and conversions to new systems such as the Amiga, Atari ST and NES. These were fairly successful such as Robocop 3, Lethal Weapon, The Addams Family.    Ocean produced fewer self published games as they focused on converting games developed by various companies over to the SNES and Game Boy consoles.   In 1998 Ocean Software purchased Digital Image Design however with the introduction of the next generation consoles; Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 very few in-house games were being developed. The last game developed by Ocean Software was Mission: Impossible for the Nintendo 64. During this year it was purchased by French Software house Infogrames for $100 million. Ocean, and its staff, merged with Infogrames to form Infogrames UK. During its 15 year history Ocean Software produced over 200 game titles.",

    "description": "Bergsala is the distributor and agent for Nintendo in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, and are also responsible for the distribution of Pokémon Trading Card Game products in Norway and Finland. Their headquarters are located in Kungbacka, Sweden.  Bergsala was founded in Kungsbacka, Sweden by Owe Bergsten, Pierre Sandsten and Lars-Göran Larsson in 1976. The name \"Bergsala\" is a combination of the three founders surnames. During the first years, Bergsten and Larsson imported electronic products that were sold in a small store in Kungsbacka.  In 1981, during a trip to the far east, Owe Bergsten purchases a portable game to keep himself occupied during the flight home. The game was a title in the Game & Watch series of products called Fire. The three owners thought that the product had potential, and contacted Nintendo via telex to investigate the possibilities to distribute Game & Watch in Sweden. After some time, Nintendo replied that the company Alga AB owned the rights to distribute Nintendos products in Sweden.  Before long, Bergsala notices that Alga didn't intend to import any Game & Watch products in Sweden. Because of that, Owe Bergsten decided to travel to Kyoto, Japan to convince Nintendo to give them a shot. Nintendo accepts. Several months passed before Bergsala managed to get their first order för Game & Watch, but after that, the interest for the strange series of portable games started to snowball. Bergsala ordered more copies, and before long, they managed to convince Nintendo to make them responsible for the distribution of Nintendo products in Norway, Finland and Denmark as well.  The money from Game & Watch enabled Bergsala to import more products from other manufacturers, none of them video game related. In 1983-1984, the combination of shrinking Game & Watch sales and a number of failed ventures resulted in severe financial problems for the company. At the same time, Nintendo begins to unveil their new console, the Nintendo Family Computer, for business partners. Bergsala tried to convince Nintendo to let them release the Famicom in Sweden, but in the end, Nintendo decided to release it in North America first. Thanks to revenue from sales of other video game systems like the Vectrex and the Intellivision, Bergsala managed to keep afloat until the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1986.  After a few months, Bergsala had sold 800,000 NES consoles in a country with 9,000,000 people. Since then, Bergsala has distributed every Nintendo console (except Virtual Boy) in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway.",

The key points of this philosophy are that BiP believe the video game industry has the power to create both fortune and failure and the real true success stories from the industry are born from the most innovative minds and development teams, thus BiP media strives to be the next Hideo Kojima or Nintendo. It is their passion to create the most entertaining video games as possible and they are meticulous about their work. They enjoy being an independent studio and never wish to live under the control of a dominating publisher, and they will continue to walk the road of uncertainty, developing games for both the hardcore and the casual, platformers and farm simulations.Above all, BiP media hopes that all the gamers out there have as much fun playing their products as they do making them, and I think that's something we can all raise a glass to.The following titles have either been developed or are currenty in development by BiP media:My FarmMy Exotic FarmMy Asian FarmMy Australian FarmViking InvasionAdvanced CircuitsJudge Dee: The City God CaseTiny Token EmpiresHellokids - Vol. 1: Coloring and PaintingVampyres in Paris",

    "description": " Namco headquarters.  Namco was originally founded in 1955 in Tokyo as Nakamura Manufacturing Ltd. by Masaya Nakamura. They began as a company that ran two rocking horse rides in a department store in Yokohama, Japan. This eventually expanded to the Tokyo area and in 1959 they changed their name to Nakamura Manufacturing Co., Ltd (Na-M-Co), which would serve as the Namco name. In the 1960s they established their own production facility for constructing rides and continued to operate more elaborate rides. They were also able to acquire a license to Disney's characters for use in them. In 1970, they developed their first coin-operated machine, Racer, a primitive driving simulator. In 1972, the company began use of the Namco name. In 1974, they acquired the struggling Atari Japan for $500,000, giving Namco the exclusive publishing rights to Atari's games in Japan for 10 years. In 1978, they released their first video game, Gee-Bee. In the same year, they established Namco America in Sunnyvale, California, which operated to license Namco's games to American distributors such as Midway Games and Atari. In 1980, they released the monumental Pac-Man. While unpopular in Japan, it saw tremendous success in North America where it was seen as a breath of fresh air in a market filled with sci-fi games such as Space Invaders or Asteroids. It became a pop culture sensation and went on to sell over 350,000 units. They continued their success with games such as Xevious, Galaga and Dig-Dug. In 1984, they began developing titles for the Nintendo Famicom under the name 'Namcot', which would prove to be a successful venture, eventually accounting for 40% of Namco's revenue. After the Video Game Crash of 1984, which split Atari into two seperate entities, Namco sold off their share of Atari to Warner Communications. By the early 90s, Namco had acquired a string of arcade distributors making it the largest arcade operator in the United States. They also ventured into amusement parks in Japan, establishing Namco Wonder Eggs in 1992 and later Empire of Eggs. In 1996 they merged the two parks, creating Namco Wonder Eggs 2. They also opened large arcades named Wonder Park, Wonder City and Wonder Tower in Sagamihara, Yokohama and Kyoto, respectively. They also continued to have arcade and home console hits such as Ridge Racer, Time Crisis and Tekken.  In 2003, they offered to merge with Sega, which rose Sega's stockprice by 15%, but the offer fell through and Namco withdrew plans after Sammy offered to merge with Sega. In September of 2005, they merged with Bandai to form Namco Bandai Holdings, and their games development merged to form Namco Bandai Games.  Pac-Man is an icon almost synonymous with video games. Namco have had a decent amount of successful franchises. Pac-Man, arguably their most popular, is comprised of over 35 games. Ace CombatBabylonian Castle SagaBaradukeDead To RightsDig-DugGalaxianKatamari Damacy  KlonoaMr. DrillerPac-ManPoint BlankRidge RacerRolling ThunderSoul CaliburSplatterhouseTaiko no TatsujinTalesTekkenTHE iDOLM@STERTime CrisisGames attached to this page should only include those developed or published by Namco prior to the merger with Bandai in 2005.

They later managed to get the rights to the games reverted and released them to the public domain.After this less than stellar experience with a major commercial publisher, they changed their name to Vision and self-published their next game, Cybernetix, as shareware in 1991, and after they this they got a few games published as coverdisc games for various magazines, but once again found themselves not getting paid. After several other publishers running away with their money they finally established a publishing deal with Mindscape and Acid Software, and later Epic Megagames, and for once they started getting royalties for their games.They were sometimes credited as Vision Software, not to be confused with the South African publisher of the same name. The studio closed down shortly after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 7th Legion in 1997.A more comprehensive history of the company is available at Back 2 the Roots.",

The game was officially announced the same year, titled Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded.In September 2011 Interceptor announced that development of Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded suspended indefinitely because of licencing problems.At QuakeCon 2012 it was announced that Interceptor Entertainment is making a remake of the 1994 classic FPS Rise of the Triad.",

After all the divisions were brought into a single building in Kyoto in summer of 2014, they have now been formally grouped under a single banner.Shigeru Miyamoto no longer acts as General Manager, with the position being taken over being former GM of SPD, Shinya Takahashi. Under him, Katsuya Eguchi (former Deputy GM of EAD) and Yoshiaki Koizumi (former GM of EAD Tokyo) will serve as Deputy General Managers of EPD.Former SPD and EAD staff will collaborate more closely on projects together under EPD.Nintendo's official statement on the consolidation of SPD and EAD into EPD:Establishment of the Entertainment Planning & Development DivisionWe will integrate personnel who are involved in the development of software for Nintendo platforms and smart devices in addition to work associated with effective utilization of character IP, and in order to create a structure that operates efficiently and rapidly, the Entertainment Analysis & Development Division and the Software Planning & Development Division will be consolidated into the newly established Entertainment Planning & Development Division.The first new title released after the restructuring will be The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes, followed by Star Fox Zero the latter of which shows the shared efforts of EAD (developing the prototype) and SPD (outsourcing production and final development to PlatinumGames).",
