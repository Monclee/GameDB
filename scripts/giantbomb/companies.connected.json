    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Electronic Arts is an American developer, publisher, marketer and distributor and is one of the largest video game companies in the world. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-18128\" href=\"/trip-hawkins/3040-18128/\">Trip Hawkins</a> founded the company in 1982 and was a pioneer in <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">the video game</a> industry. When originally formed, EA was a publishing house, but slowly began to develop in-house games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8819\" href=\"/skate-or-die/3030-8819/\">Skate or Die</a>. EA then began to purchase various developers, quickly becoming one of the largest publishers in the industry.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5028/1777475-electronic_arts.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777475\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 760px\" data-ratio=\"0.37894736842105\" data-width=\"760\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5028/1777475-electronic_arts.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777475\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5028/1777475-electronic_arts.png\"></a><figcaption>Electronic Arts original logo</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Trip Hawkins originally created the company as Amazin' Software. Hawkins quickly began filling the roster with former co-workers from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\" href=\"/apple-inc/3010-5815/\">Apple</a>. Hawkins had a <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">sales strategy</a> to sell directly to the buyers. This proved difficult because retailers were interested in well-known brands such as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"/atari-inc/3010-182/\">Atari</a>. However, Amazin' Software thrived, earning revenue of $11 million. Despite success, many of Amazin' Software's internal employees disliked the name of the company. After several meetings, they had a new name: Electronic Arts. The name change came with other changes and after 9 years as the CEO, Hawkins left Electronic Arts and formed <a data-ref-id=\"3010-224\" href=\"/the-3do-company/3010-224/\">3DO</a>.</p><p style=\"\">After Hawkins departure, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-21205\" href=\"/laurie-probst/3040-21205/\">Larry Probst</a> filled his position. Probst wanted EA to be lead with principle and integrity and refused to allow EA to publish any M-rated games, which had become more of a mainstay in the industry. This caused problems for EA and the company's stock fell significantly. Probst faced major criticism from the public and investors alike. Under mounting pressure, he eventually changed his stance on M-rated games. EA published its first M-rated game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8870\" href=\"/system-shock-2/3030-8870/\">System Shock 2</a>, in 1999. This change marked a new beginning for EA, historically signaling the company's rise to become one of the prominent and largest publishers in the industry.</p><p style=\"\">In 2004, EA purchased the exclusive license of ESPN and the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">NFL</a>. This was seen as one of the largest deals in video game history. Many gamers felt that the 2K series was of much higher quality than the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">Madden series</a> and it forced the series on any gamer wanting to play a NFL title. EA would then go on to acquire the exclusive license to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-485\" href=\"/ncaa-football/3025-485/\">NCAA football</a>, furthering expanding their foothold in football. EA capitalized on its licensing deals, instating yearly releases of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">Madden</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-609\" href=\"/fifa-soccer/3025-609/\">FIFA</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-590\" href=\"/nhl/3025-590/\">NHL</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-494\" href=\"/nba-live/3025-494/\">NBA Live</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-455\" href=\"/pga-tour-golf/3025-455/\">Tiger Woods PGA Tour</a>, and more.</p><p style=\"\">In 2007, Probst stepped down from his position as CEO and appointed <a data-ref-id=\"3040-65707\" href=\"/john-riccitiello/3040-65707/\">John Riccitiello</a> to CEO. Under Riccitiello, Electronic Arts would expand further than ever. Riccitiello went on to purchase major game developers, including <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2628\" href=\"/mythic-entertainment/3010-2628/\">Mythic Entertainment</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1779\" href=\"/pandemic-studios/3010-1779/\">Pandemic Studios</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-98\" href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\">BioWare</a>. Riccitiello also made a bid for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-450\" href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\">Take-Two</a>, EA's main competitor. The bid lead to very long series of delays and changes to the deal but was ultimately declined by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-450\" href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\">Take-Two</a>. Critics say it was a bad decision not to accept the deal, as nobody else would offer them a price even close to EA's. Gamers were very pleased with this, as some of their favorite franchises would not be \"lost\" to EA (such as <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\">GTA</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\" href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\">Bioshock</a>). If the deal had gone through, the acquisition would have been the largest deal in video game history.</p><p style=\"\">On July 31, 2008, Hall of Fame football player <a data-ref-id=\"3040-18531\" href=\"/jim-brown/3040-18531/\">Jim Brown</a> sued EA for \"unspecified damages for trademark infringement, unauthorized use of his likeness, trademark dilution and unfair business practices and competition.” Brown's claim was on the \"All-Browns\" team in Electronic Arts' <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\">Madden</a> series the running back is African American player wearing the number 32. This player is obviously meant to be Jim Brown. Brown also demanded that his likeness be removed from the game.</p><h2>Criticism</h2><p style=\"\">Electronic Arts had historically been recognized as one of the most hated video game companies in the industry. Many gamers see EA as trying to form a monopoly by acquiring many game developers and publishers. Some also believe once EA acquires a developer, the quality of that studios titles drop due to EA trying to meddle with and milk the franchises owned by these companies. EA also receives criticism because of their yearly installations of their games. Many feel that these games are just very small changes between them and that they are rushed out each year.</p><p style=\"\">Starting in late 2007/early 2008 however, EA has earned new respect and recognition from gamers. While still developing and publishing their annual franchises, EA’s focus shifted towards new - and often innovative - IP's. Titles published and developed in 07/08 such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5228\" href=\"/skate/3030-5228/\">Skate</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21213\" href=\"/mirrors-edge/3030-21213/\">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20800\" href=\"/dead-space/3030-20800/\">Dead Space</a> have helped significantly increase EA's reputation among gamers. This, along with deliberately antagonistic comments from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6397\" href=\"/activision-blizzard-inc/3010-6397/\">Activision Blizzard</a> CEO <a data-ref-id=\"3040-14885\" href=\"/robert-kotick/3040-14885/\">Bobby Kotick</a>, has helped lend credence to the phrase \"Activision is the new EA.”</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, EA has lost many of its <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a> fans due to its installations of the anti-piracy software <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2720\" href=\"/securom/3015-2720/\">SecuROM</a>, though this has backfired, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14139\" href=\"/spore/3030-14139/\">Spore</a>, a game with plenty of controversy over this security software, became the #1 most pirated game of 2008. In 2012, the company was also awarded the title as the <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/2012/04/04/congratulations-ea-you-are-the-worst-company-in-america-for-2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Worst Company in America\"</a> by The Consumerist via an online voting ballot.</p><h2>Company Structure</h2><p style=\"\">EA's structure consists of four major division called Labels, with each studio owned by EA falling into one of the three Labels. EA Labels is headed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-11860\" href=\"/frank-gibeau/3040-11860/\">Frank Gibeau</a>. EA Labels consist of</p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\">EA Games</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\" href=\"/ea-sports/3010-6255/\">EA Sports</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3010-7697\" href=\"/ea-play/3010-7697/\">EA Play</a></li></ul><p style=\"\">EA has a sub-Label called <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7698\" href=\"/ea-interactive/3010-7698/\">EA Interactive</a> which consists of studios developing games for the Mobile and Social markets.</p>",

After graduating from UCLA a year before, the three computing graduates decided to form a gaming company called Silicon &amp; Synapse, which referred to the building block of the computer (silicon) and the human mind (synapse).</p><p style=\"\">Under that name, the company developed games for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super NES</a> like <a href=\"/rock-n-roll-racing/3030-18026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18026\">Rock n' Roll Racing</a>, <a href=\"/the-lost-vikings/3030-5429/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5429\">The Lost Vikings</a> and <a href=\"/blackthorne/3030-4549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4549\">Blackthorne</a>. Silicon &amp; Synapse garnered many awards within those years but received backlash for its company name. Many mistook it to be a breast implant firm because of the word <i>\"silicon,\"</i> which led them to briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios but it did not help either. Many people had trouble pronouncing the name (mispronunciations ranged from <i>\"chows\"</i> to <i>\"Chads\"</i>) and discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.</p><p style=\"\">In early 1994 they were acquired by distributor Davidson &amp; Associates for $6.75 million. The same year the three year old gaming company switched its name to Ogre Studios but Davidson &amp; Associates went against it because they felt <i>\"ogre\"</i> was too scary for the target audience. Finally, after numerous discussions within the team, they finally settled on Blizzard Entertainment.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Blizzard's three main intellectual properties include the <a href=\"/warcraft/3025-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-4\">Warcraft</a><b>,</b> <a href=\"/starcraft/3025-326/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-326\">StarCraft</a>, and <a href=\"/diablo/3025-148/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-148\">Diablo</a> franchises. Each franchise boasts an impressive, and almost \"cult-like\" following of fans, that have made Blizzard one of the most easily recognizable names in the gaming industry today.</p><p style=\"\">In July 2008 Vivendi Games, who at the time owned Blizzard Entertainment, merged with game publisher <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a>. Using Blizzard's name as a marketing tool to promote the company and deal as a merger and not a direct buyout, named the resulting company <a href=\"/activision-blizzard-inc/3010-6397/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6397\">Activision Blizzard</a>.</p><h3>Conventions</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13913/337924-murky.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337924\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3045454545455\" data-width=\"220\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13913/337924-murky.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337924\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13913/337924-murky.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A \"Murky\" pet that was given away to attendees of the first Blizzcon in 2005.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It is due to this incredible community that has developed around these three unique IPs and the unprecedented success of their hit titles like <i>StarCraft</i> and <i>World of Warcraft</i> that Blizzard is able to host it's own convention's; namely <u><b>BlizzCon</b></u> and the <u><b>Worldwide Invitational</b></u> (or WWI). These conventions boast a number of incredible events such as tournaments for <a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">Warcraft 3</a>, <a href=\"/starcraft/3030-13062/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\">StarCraft,</a> <a href=\"/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/3030-42033/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42033\">Hearthstone</a> and <a href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\">World of Warcraft</a> arena tournaments, costume and machinima contests, as well as major announcements concerning their three flagship franchises.</p><ul><li>The first BlizzCon was held in Anaheim, California at the Anaheim Convention Center in 2005 and has since been held on a semi-regular basis. It has been held since in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In July 2008, Blizzard announced they would be partnering with DirectTV to televise BlizzCon 2008.</li><li>The third Worldwide Invitational was held in May 2007 in Seoul, Korea and featured the unveiling of the highly anticipated <a href=\"/starcraft-ii/3030-20674/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\">StarCraft II</a>. The fourth WWI was held in Paris, France in June 2008 with the announcement of <a href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III</a> and information concerning the second expansion to their massive multiplayer online RPG World of Warcraft, <a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20701\">The Wrath of the Lich King</a>. Previous WWI events were held in Seoul, Korea and featured professional, or \"eSports\" tournaments but no new product announcements.</li><li>On top of the many prizes and tournaments going on, Blizzard has also made a habit out of giving away special codes that can be redeemed in World of Warcraft for different aesthetic purposes. Things such as in-game pets that follow a player around, or a suit that dresses them up are just a few things that Blizzard has given away exclusively at their events.</li><li>Blizzard has announced and is holding the next Blizzcon in August of 2009. The convention will, as the previous Blizzcon of 2008, be available to non-attendee's through DirectTV for a nominal fee. It will also be available for purchase to be viewed via a streaming feed online.</li><li>Blizzard has announced that BlizzCon 2010 is scheduled for October 2010 at the Anaheim Convention Center.</li><li>Blizzard canceled BlizzCon 2012, in order to have more time to work on their current projects.</li></ul><h3><b>Battle.net</b></h3><p style=\"\">In 1997 Blizzard released an online gaming service called <a href=\"/battlenet/3015-2077/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2077\"><b>Battle.net</b></a> that allows players from around the world to play together for free. This service has been implemented into most of Blizzard's titles. Battle.net has an array of functions including a matchmaking service and custom gameplay support that allows players to create their own maps and game types to share and play online. One such game type called <b>Defense of the Ancients</b> (or DoTA) in WarCraft 3 has since grown to become somewhat of a phenomenon similar to the original Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life.</p><p style=\"\">With the release of StarCraft II, Blizzard announced that an all new Battle.net service titled Battle.net 2.0 will launch concurrently with the game. Battle.net 2.0 features cross game features with all upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, including backwards compatibility with World of WarCraft. In 2009, Blizzard required all World of Warcraft accounts be changed into battle.net accounts to prepare for the service.</p><h2>Games of Blizzard</h2><h3>As Silicon &amp; Synapse</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/radical-pyscho-machine-racing/3030-28137/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28137\">RPM Racing</a></b> (1991)</li><li><b><a href=\"/the-lost-vikings/3030-5429/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5429\">The Lost Vikings</a></b> (1992)</li><li><b><a href=\"/rock-n-roll-racing/3030-18026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18026\">Rock N' Roll Racing</a></b> (1993)</li></ul><h3>As Blizzard Entertainment</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/blackthorne/3030-4549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4549\">Blackthorne</a></b> (1994)</li><li><b><a href=\"/the-death-and-return-of-superman/3030-11075/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11075\">The Death and Return of Superman</a></b> (1994)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-orcs-humans/3030-9719/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9719\">Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</a></b> (1994)</li><li><a href=\"/justice-league-task-force/3030-16349/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16349\"><b>Justice League Task Force</b></a> (1995)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-ii-tides-of-darkness/3030-20103/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20103\">Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</a></b> (1995)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-ii-beyond-the-dark-portal/3030-11816/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11816\">Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal</a></b> (1996)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo/3030-5985/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5985\">Diablo</a></b> (1996)</li><li><b><a href=\"/norse-by-norse-west-the-return-of-the-lost-vikings/3030-4134/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4134\">The Lost Vikings II</a></b> (1997)</li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft/3030-13062/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\">StarCraft</a></b> (1998)</li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-brood-war/3030-5415/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5415\">StarCraft: Brood War</a></b> (1998)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo-ii/3030-1119/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1119\">Diablo II</a></b> (2000)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction/3030-15589/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15589\">Diablo II: Lord of Destruction</a></b> (2001)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</a></b> (2002)</li><li><b><a href=\"/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/3030-14073/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14073\">Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</a></b> (2003)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\">World of Warcraft</a></b> (2004)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/3030-18603/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18603\">World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</a></b> (2007)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20701\">World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</a></b> (2008)</li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\">StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</a></b> (2010)</li><li><b><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/3030-27896/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27896\">World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</a></b> (2010)</li><li><b><a href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III</a></b> (2012)</li><li><strong><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/3030-36734/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36734\">World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria</a></strong> (2012)</li><li><strong><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/3030-24078/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24078\">StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm</a> </strong>(2013)</li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/3030-42033/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42033\"><b>Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</b></a> (2014)</li><li><strong><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/3030-43649/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43649\">Diablo III: Reaper of</a><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/3030-43649/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43649\"> Souls</a> </strong>(2014)</li><li><strong><a href=\"/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/3030-44468/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44468\">World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor</a></strong> (2014)</li><li><b><a href=\"/heroes-of-the-storm/3030-36739/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36739\">Heroes of the Storm</a> </b>(2015)</li></ul><h3>Games In Development or Rumored</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/3030-24079/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24079\">StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void</a></b></li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/overwatch/3030-48190/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48190\">Overwatch</a></b></li></ul><h3>Games Cancelled</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/warcraft-adventures-lord-of-the-clans/3030-21298/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21298\"><b>Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans</b></a></li><li><b><a href=\"/starcraft-ghost/3030-21221/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21221\">StarCraft Ghost</a></b></li><li><a href=\"/titan-working-title/3030-33432/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33432\"><b>Titan</b></a></li></ul><h2>Key Figures</h2><ul><li><b><a href=\"/michael-morhaime/3040-3442/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3442\">Michael Morhaime</a></b> -
