It boasts an array of new elements and upgraded modes, including a vast selection of 83 unique playable characters, the option to create original characters through the edit mode, as well as the ability to customize horses, banners, and NPC officers. Warriors are called to fight not only against enemies, but also the forces of nature as the changing seasons and the passing of time alter fighting conditions on more than 40 battlefields.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the game’s Custom Scenario mode adds the ability to control events across the vast Chinese continent, allowing players to adjust every last detail to form a brand new Three Kingdoms world. Finally, in Empire mode, players can choose to adopt one of many distinct roles or to experience the epic history and its outcomes through a different methodology of warfare.",

You play as a Shield Maiden. Like other mortal Norsemen, her fate was to be determined pre-birth by the three fate-weaving Norns, but for no reason other than his own tormented sadistic gratification, Loki interfered, dripping spots of wretched Eitr into the unwoven fate loom, determining the fate of an unborn child and simultaneously causing the light to fade from Yggdrasil. It is this Shield Maidens quest to restore the light to Yggdrasil, or watch the nine Norse worlds fade into inevitable darkness.",

At its core is a story exploration path free from puzzles where you can unfold the story at your own pace. There is also a deeper, more adventurous path in which you can complete complex puzzles to restore life changing events of the patients history in order to help the validation of their life. \r\n\r\nParallel paths make Ether One accessible to a range of skilled players. Invite your friends and family around to pick their brains for help taking on challenging environmental puzzles, or soak in the atmosphere of Pinwheel at leisure. From a young age we enjoyed the first person puzzle games that required you to write cryptic notes on spare pieces of paper to unravel mysteries. Ether One aims to bring back pen and paper puzzle solving, whilst still being accessible and optional for people not wanting to get stuck and frustrated on the harder puzzles.",

Built from the legendary DNA of its award-winning predecessor, Far Cry 4 delivers the most expansive and immersive Far Cry experience ever in an entirely new and massive open world with a new weapons, vehicles, wildlife and more. \r\n\r\nIn Far Cry 4, you’ll conquer fortress outposts from the back of a six-ton elephant and take to the skies as you rain down explosives from the seat of your gyrocopter. The vertical landscape of the Himalayas isn’t just a pretty backdrop, but a playground that encourages the player to fight, hunt and explore, grappling up cliffs or launching into the air, plummeting to the valley below in a controlled free fall with your wing suit. You’ll carry with you a truly unique arsenal of weaponry that lets you play your way, whether it’s sniping, sneaking or all-out assault. When all else fails, animals can be your biggest allies or your greatest danger, as Kyrat’s wilderness delivers on the promise of a true open world anecdote factory.",

    "Summary": "Square Enix brings back two of the most popular RPGs of all time with this bundle of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X, both remastered in glorious HD! \r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy X follows the exploits of the Summoner Yuna and her guardians as they battle an evil immortal enemy known as Sin. This beloved entry in the franchise includes side-quests such as the underwater sport of Blitzball and a monster battle arena, as well as a redesigned fighting system that mixes classic Final Fantasy elements with a \"Sphere Grid\" system. \r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy X-2 is the first true sequel in the popular RPG series, and picks the story up two years later. The world has entered into a period known as the \"Eternal Calm\". During this moment of change, the people of Spira have shunned the once-sacred teachings of Yevon, and embraced the use of the formerly forbidden machina. While many of Spira's inhabitants are enjoying this time of peace, evidence of the High Summoner Yuna's lost love Tidus surfaces, prompting her to begin a new quest to find him.",
