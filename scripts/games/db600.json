Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he was unable to even talk to his wife and son in Boulder thanks to strict security protocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core. \r\n\r\nAlthough Whistleblower tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.",

Assisting gamers once again are the mighty, maniacal and occasionally moronic minions, ready to unleash their charmingly chaotic brand of destruction and led by Gnarl, their wise old master. Gamers take up the role of one of four Netherghūls, undead servants of the dark arts determined to bring evil back to a world overrun by the forces of good. \r\n \r\nBut where’s the fun in smiting fools alone? Join the Fellowship, grab three of your most devious friends - locally or online - and gleefully unleash a wave of delightful destruction across the land. It’s good to be bad, but it’s GREAT to be evil.",

It affects the neural and the blood-circulating systems, crippling both body and mind. To fight the epidemic the local authorities first send a learned doctor, then an inquisitor ordered to assess the situation, then a military commander with the option to impose extreme measures if he deems the risk too dangerous should options run out. Along with the authorities’ agents, two volunteers find their way through the Town along with the learned doctor, who goes by the name of The Bachelor. One of them, The Changeling, is a strange girl who believes she can heal with her hands, and the other, The Haruspex, is a talented amateur who’s fond of experimental surgery. \r\n\r\nIn this high-definition remake of Pathalogic, you on the role of one of these doctors, exploring the town, its weird traditions, and the complex relationships of its inhabitants. You will only have twelve days to defeat the invisible enemy called the Sand Plague. Time will become one of your most precious resources. Choices will haunt your every step. You’ll want to get closer to your goal, but sometimes it’ll all come down to mere survival. In a time when everyone is in danger, would you lend a gun to a person who may use it with ill intent? Would you try to save someone who claims they don’t need to be saved? Would you share your medicine with important figures who will unveil the Town’s numerous secrets in return, or would you rather help an ordinary stranger in need? Or maybe even selfishly keep the pills in case you get sick? And, sooner or later, you will -- Pathologic is a bleak and harsh survival adventure that never gives you the easy answers.",

    "Summary": "PlayStation VR is virtual reality technology designed for use with PlayStation 4 game systems.  \r\n\r\nIntroduced at GDC 2014, the PlayStation VR (known as \"Project Morpheus\") prototype virtual reality (VR) system features a head mounted display with 1080p resolution and a 90 degree field of view. Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors built into the head mounted unit as well as PlayStation Camera accurately tracks head orientation and movement, so as your head rotates, the image of the virtual world rotates intuitively in real-time. PlayStation VR also features 3D audio technology that re-creates stereoscopic sounds in all directions and changes in real-time depending on your head orientation. In addition to PlayStation Camera, PlayStation VR works with DualShock 4 Wireless Controller and PlayStation Move to deliver an easy-to-use, plug-and-play VR experience. \r\n\r\n(Details are applicable to the current PlayStation VR prototype and are subject to change in the final release.)",

'Deceive or Destroy' gameplay allows gamers the choice to either blend in with the population and covertly progress through the story, or fully unleash Alex's powers, and move through New York City like a walking slaughterhouse, taking control of military vehicles, and causing destruction at every turn. \r\n\r\nThe explosive sequel Prototype 2 takes the unsurpassed carnage of the original and continues the experience of becoming the ultimate shape-shifting weapon. A devastating viral outbreak has claimed the lives of Sgt James Heller’s family and transformed him into a Prototype. Powered by incredible new shapeshifting powers and abilities, you must hunt, kill and consume your way across the infected wasteland of New York Zero to take revenge on the man responsible: Alex Mercer.",
