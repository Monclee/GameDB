What Tony lacks in smarts he more than makes up for in gun-toting belligerence. The only thing that can keep up with his trigger finger is his penchant for sarcastic one-liners. \r\n \r\nPlayers target waves of hurt-hungry hoodlums by making a schoolyard-style pistol shape with their hand and moving it above the Leap Motion Controller. When they find a bad guy, autofire takes care of the rest. But players need to think fast, and keep their line of sight clear, or it’ll be Tony’s funeral instead of the enemy’s.",

Progression of the demonic influence will be reflected by the transformation of the hero's body. \r\n\r\nThrough its different chapters, Bound by Flame offers many quests around a primary, epic adventure. Depending on the choices made by the player and the influence of the demon, some chapters will offer different scenarios and a different experience, adding important replayability to the game. If the player begins the game knowing only the basics of combat, fire magic, and assassination, he will be able to specialize by unlocking and improving many skills and powers, through three different skill trees.",

The explosions (which are numerous) often result in unpredictable chain reactions, but this shouldn't discourage you from permanently holding down your trigger finger.",

Cabela’s African Adventures takes you into the wildest of continents where you’ll hunt for the biggest of the Big Five -- lion, leopard, white rhinoceros, Cape buffalo and elephant. But watch your back -- you’re on their turf now. This fast-paced adventure is packed with animal encounters that will challenge your fight or flight instincts. The story-driven journey immerses you in an open world where you’re free to explore – from verdant savannahs to sun-seared desert and overgrown jungle. Let intuition be your guide as you traverse the lands on foot or by truck, entering and exiting your vehicle whenever and wherever you want. As you progress through the story, you’ll discover hunting zones, collectables, new objectives and, of course, Africa’s most ferocious beasts. Experience earned along the way will unlock new weapons and abilities, allowing you to customize your loadouts for strategic choices in the field. You’ll need them -- your targets are nothing less than Africa’s deadliest, wiliest creatures and without keen, stealthy instincts, you’ll quickly turn from predator to prey. For a true test of reflex, skill and courage, pit yourself against the intense arcade action of the Shooting Gallery, featuring Hot Seat mode, supporting up to four players.",

Delivering a stunning performance, Academy Award winning actor Kevin Spacey stars as Jonathan Irons -- one of the most powerful men in the world -- shaping this chilling vision of the future of war. The game takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and today's military practices have converged with powerful consequences. •\tIn this carefully researched and crafted vision of the future, Private Military Corporations (PMCs) have become the dominant armed forces for countless nations outsourcing their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting the rules of war. And Jonathan Irons, the founder and president of the world's largest PMC, Atlas Corporation, is at the center of it all. \r\n\r\nSuit up for combat in exoskeletons that evolve every aspect of a soldier's battle readiness, enabling combatants to deploy with an advanced lethality and eliminating the need for specialization. Players experience enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide unparalleled strength, awareness, endurance, and speed. With the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before, fundamentally changing the way gamers play Call of Duty across all modes.",

Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary. \r\n\r\nAt the start of the game, each member of the team chooses from one of several custom character classes - medic, engineer, tank, and weapon specialist. As the team battles through the streets of Caldera Peak, players earn currency that can be used to purchase a variety of upgrades and character abilities. The team can scavenge for special equipment and weapon mods left behind by previous, unsuccessful, military forces. \r\n\r\nExtinction’s fast-paced survival combat features a series of intense base-defense scenarios. The team members must work together to hold off waves of alien attackers until each alien “hive” can be neutralized. The team can fortify their positions using a variety of military-issue and improvised defenses: electrified fences, fire traps, shock puddles, heavy weapon turrets, and drones. During each game session players will also earn Skill Points that can be used to buff their loadouts, enabling players to develop highly-specialized skill sets over the course of a single game. No two games are the same as the moment to moment upgrade decisions can dictate the strategies of the team. Team Challenges also allow teams to earn extra Skill Points, buffing their capabilities even further. Your overall objective is to destroy the alien threat with the help of a nuclear device. Once the team finds the nuke, they must arm it, race back through the town to escape on their chopper - mad dash race through an insane gauntlet of alien terror!",
