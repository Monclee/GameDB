It features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay. \r\n\r\nUnlike most top-down shooters, which give multiple players a shared pool of lives or continues, Jamestown does something different. So long as any player survives, the team can be brought back from death. By giving every player the power to rescue their team from the jaws of destruction, Jamestown creates an exhilarating cooperative experience where everyone’s contribution truly matters. Win or lose, your team will do it together. \r\n\r\nThis Jamestown Plus version of the hit shooter contains the entire original experience as well as a lot of cool new content to celebrate the console release. Included are new ships (replete with innovative special attacks and customizable weapon systems) and new levels (taking players on a swashbuckling adventure to the mysterious Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos.) Also features is a brand new chapter of the Jamestown story that spans space and time, adds new dimension to established characters and locations, and finishes what the original game started.",

Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate the dangerous creatures rampantly destroying mankind. \r\n\r\nDelivering an even more visceral and viscera-spewing shooter experience than the original, Killing Floor 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party,  limb from limb. New enemies and fan favorites from the original game are back with expanded and smarter artificial intelligence, dishing out powerful attacks, working as a group to weaken the player’s party and pushing the challenge level and fear factor to new levels.",
