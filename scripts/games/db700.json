    "Summary": "Take the helm of official teams and clubs from the most prestigious leagues: the Aviva Premiership Rugby, the PRO 12 and, in a world exclusive, the TOP 14 and PRO D2! In addition to being able to play friendly matches either solo or with other players, rugby fans will also be able to take part in the official championships of 4 major European leagues: TOP 14, Aviva Premiership Rugby, PRO 12 and PRO D2. All of the teams and rules for each of these championships are faithfully respected, and players will have to battle in order to raise the Brennus Shield or to become champions of England. For this first in the series, Rugby 15 also includes 20 of the major national teams and 15 southern hemisphere teams, although without the official licences. There is an editor mode as well, so the most dedicated fans can find the most famous names in these teams. Finally, ‘Custom tournament’ mode lets players create their own competitions by setting the rules (number of participants, type of competition, playoff, knock-out…) and giving you the chance to mix and match all of the teams in the game. Give full rein to your imagination and create the league of your dreams!",

Environments is more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows. Powerful new visual systems allow for smooth movement and motion transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced post-processing effects. \r\n\r\nUnlike the previous adventures of Sherlock Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator during the detective's investigation. It is now your turn to truly become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation–actually, your investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders, disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring you to the cutting edge of the detective genre. Each case, written in the pure tradition of Conan Doyle's novels, offers real freedom to players, who will have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and affect your character’s reputation in addition to having realistic, sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by giving true depth to every decision they make.",

    "Summary": "Shift Happens is a puzzle platformer focusing on cooperation, with gameplay tuned for either single-player or on-the-couch multiplayer play.  At its core the game revolves around the \"Shift\" and the two protagonists \"Bismo\" and \"Plom\". Bound together by accident, they can shift their masses between each other. If one of them shifts, they both change their sizes: the big gets small and the small one gets big! This core mechanic allows for challenging puzzles and funny interaction between the players. Cooperation and communication is the key to succeed. \r\n\r\nThe game consists of four stages: the laboratory, the forest, the canyon and the grotto. Each with a unique art-style and gameplay. Shift Happens encourages two players to play together and collaborate to finish the game, but it also comes with a singleplayer mode that has a whole different set of level content.",
