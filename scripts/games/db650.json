This version of Q*bert features two games: the Classic pixel perfect 2D form, and the re-imagined Rebooted version with state-of-the-art 3D game-play and graphics that remain faithful to the original concept. Both versions are exciting twitch games requiring keen puzzle solving skills and logic. \r\n\r\nQ*bert Classic stays true to the original in all its jagged 2D pixel art glory. As the title grawlix-spewing character, players jump around an isometric cube pyramid and convert each block’s color while avoiding familiar adversaries Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, Wrong Way and Red Ball. Levels become progressively harder with more enemies blocking your path and the tiles requiring multiple jumps to change to the required color. \r\n\r\nThe Rebooted mode takes the arcade classic and catapults it into the 21st Century 3D game play that takes full advantage of today’s technologies yet remains faithful to the original Q*bert. Featuring hexagonal blocks instead of squares, Q*bert Rebooted introduces new enemies, playable characters, power-ups, traps, gem collecting, multiple characters, downloadable content and new ways to play.",

There's only one thing for Baldren to do: he has to seal the gate and warp himself back to his home planet. This is easier said than done, since the gate can only be sealed by a dimensional gate staff and no such object is available anywhere on Rainbow Moon. However Baldren knows that he can create one if he finds the right materials. He needs seven magical artifacts, said to be hidden deep inside Rainbow Moon's dungeons.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where our quest begins ...",

The sinister beauty of the 17th Century Caribbean is revealed in the rolling emerald waves and their secrets, kept far beneath; in the dark alleys and curved, cobbled roads, all teeming with murderous miscreants and loudly drunken braves, the prophets of the bottle, the blade, and the flintlock gun. The historically accurate architecture and in-game events will flavor the three major cities found in Raven’s Cry with the atmosphere players crave, as they traverse from the unsavory pirate holdfast of Port Royal to the elegant avenues of luscious Havana, to a lost Aztec City deep in the jungles of the Spanish Main.",

    "Summary": "Neo-Tokyo is shrouded in lies and corruption. A massive wall stands between the wealthy and the poor as Rena Nakano, cyborg and president of Nexus Roku Corporation, leads the country into darkness. Manufacturing augmentations for human beings, Nexus Roku promises an easier life. But by embedding chips into their patients and buying out those who would expose them, Nexus Roku is able to alter the behavioral patterns of society to be docile and compliant, giving Rena Nakano unrivaled power and control. Once used to seal away the Tengu Demon Sojobo, Rena Nakano is in search for the ancient pearl in hopes that upon freeing Sojobo, he will grant her immortality as a reward. Within this societal turbulence, a handful of unlikely heroes find themselves leading the resistance not only to Rena Nakano’s greed, but perhaps saving the world from Sojobo, and ultimately death, altogether. Based on the real historical swordsman, Musashi Miyamoto leads this group through a plot teeming with deceit, violence, love, betrayal and sacrifice against a backdrop inspired by traditional Japanese lore. Rich with philosophical themes and generous subtext, Reborn tells a tale that asks the question, “What is freedom without free will?” \r\n\r\nReborn is a sci-fi action RPG with the real-time combat of action games and the depth of traditional RPGs, including an experience and leveling system, progressive License Board, rare loot, and various character classes , and downloadable content (upon reaching higher stretch goals.) Reborn follows the high energy adventures of a futuristic version of the famed Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto. The year is 2188; the people of Japan once embraced a life of spirituality and harmony with nature, but now they’re obsessed with technology, forcing it into every aspect of their lives, becoming willing slaves. But some see the destruction of their culture, and rebel against the modern system. As Musashi, you will travel the streets of Neo-Tokyo, clashing with cyber-enhanced gangs and oppressive corporate overlords in your attempt to find “a better path.”",

    "Summary": "The intense horror fans first experienced with the release of the original Resident Evil in 1996 is back in this HD remastering of the classic that improves on the praised 2002 \"REmake\". Taking place in the now notorious Raccoon City, players choose to take on the role of either S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team member Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine who have been sent into the city to find the missing Bravo team. When the team is suddenly attacked by a ferocious group of mutated dogs, desperate for an escape they take shelter in the Mansion, but will they ever get out alive again? Players will need to be brave as they adventure through the dark, enclosed spaces searching out the horrors that await them. With limited ammo and survival items available gamers will need to keep their wits about them to survive the various traps and puzzles that greet them at every stage.\r\n\r\nEnhanced for HD game platforms, resolutions and textures have been significantly upgraded, resulting in characters and backgrounds coming to life in greater detail than ever seen before in Resident Evil. Not only will the graphics impress but the tense sound effects have been fully remastered with 5.1 surround support for a greater gaming atmosphere. Players can choose between classic 4:3 ratio or a custom 16:9 widescreen mode that scrolls with the action. The classic control scheme remains for fans of the original play style or there's an alternative scheme where the character moves directly in the direction of the analogue stick.",

Both terrifying games have been brought to new new levels of horror with new HD visuals, improved sound, widescreen support, an optional modernized control system and more. \r\n\r\nRESIDENT EVIL 0: The story of Resident Evil 0 takes players back to 1998. Reports have been mounting about unusual murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. The city’s Special Forces division, S.T.A.R.S., sends their Bravo Team -- including rookie cop member Rebecca Chambers - to investigate. On route, the team’s helicopter suffers engine trouble and is forced to make a crash landing, where they find an overturned prisoner transport vehicle. Splitting up to search the area, Rebecca discovers the Ecliptic Express, a train stopped dead on the tracks. Inside, she meets death row convict and ex-Navy lieutenant Billy Coen. Throughout the game, players will take control of both Rebecca and Billy, at times switching between both characters in order to proceed. Learning the advantages of each character is the key to solving puzzles and surviving the nightmares that lie ahead.\r\n\r\nRESIDENT EVIL HD: The intense horror fans first experienced with the release of the original Resident Evil is back.
