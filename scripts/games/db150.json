If only that dead King would keep quiet... \r\n\r\nThe Chariotâ€™s large wheels and long tethers allow the heroes to reach higher ground, swing across chasms and perform all sorts of impressive maneuvers. Extract riches from the very walls of the caves in multiple environments, and make your way to the exit by avoiding envious looters or by beating them back as they attempt to steal your hard-earned loot! With skill-testing coordination mechanics and thrilling physics-based stunts required, Chariot will definitely please couch coop enthusiasts as teamwork and cooperation unlocks new possibilities.",

The town's miners have recently disappeared after breaching a long-forgotten temple far below the town, and reawakened an ancient slumbering evil. Now trapped in the town by supernatural forces, you're left with no option but to explore the mines below, battle enemies and bosses, and increase your abilities in hopes of finally escaping and returning home.",

After recently winning the vice presidency, he returns to his rural home town for some vacation. But he soon inadvertently discovers that there is some very strange stuff happening around town. Feeling a sense of responsibility as an elected official you decide to do something about it! But being the bureaucrat you are, you don't actually want to get your hands dirty. Thus you go about using your charisma to recruit normal townsfolk to help you investigate and fight your battles for you. \r\n\r\nThe game defies traditional hero types and character classes seen in RPGs -- instead, you're able to recruit and fight with the town Baker, Barista, School Teacher, Homeless Guy, and plenty of other seemingly ordinary characters brought to life in unique and charming ways!",

    "Summary": "Alyssa L'Salle is one of the galactic governmentâ€™s top agents and always manages to save the day! But when she accidentally uncovers a dark conspiracy, her own government outs her as a legendary spy and the peopleâ€™s champion! Sure, now she has hordes of adoring fans but every villainous organization sheâ€™s ever crossed in her career knows who she is and is out for her blood! Can she save the day once more while she faces her greatest challenge ... Everyone!? \r\n\r\nCosmic Star Heroine is a humorous sci-fi RPG adventure from Zeboyd Games. The game has designed with classic 2D pixel art and turn-based RPG mechanics while still pushing forward play and design aspects over the team's previous hits. Players will be able to customize their own spy headquarters by recruiting more agents, and combat will take place inside the gameplay map rather than in a cut-away view.",

But this is causing an imbalance on the island, causing monsters to appear out of nowhere and sapping the town's resources. Spunky bookworm who goes by the name of Esmyrelda Maximus (nicknamed Esmy) is passionate and a good candidate for Cryamore research, so she is commissioned by the Town Council Chief to search for alternate Cryamore resources, which spirals into a much more ominous dilemma.",

How can something so pretty be so damned evil? Well, spawned from the bullet-hell spattered brain of Rob Fearon, how can it be any other way? Are games art? This question has been answered: loud and clear. Dead again. And again. And again. But progressing nicely with every game.",
