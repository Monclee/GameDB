But Mike only made it to 170, and we lost Erin after 105. Turns out, life in space is just that: life, with moods and jealousies and infuriating little failures. Only you're a few million miles from civilization, so humanity's frailties also happen to be deadly.\r\n\r\nTharsis is a turn-based, perma-death, realistic space strategy game. With dice. And cannibalism. It puts you in control of the first manned mission to Mars, just as it’s struck by a hulking asteroid. But some part of you knows this landing is possible. In fact, the more you think about those signals from the Tharsis region, the less you believe you'd be first to set foot there...Defy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on the most important rescue mission in all of mankind.",

Throughout his journey, Spider-Man will encounter a number of new foes as well as some old friends, as he confronts a new threat to his beloved city. The narrative will give Peter Parker, Spider-Man’s nerdy photojournalist persona, a greater role in the spotlight, as he investigates the complicated motivations and unique personalities behind the menagerie of Marvel menaces threatening Manhattan. \r\n\r\nAs Spidey, players will be able to free-roam through a greatly-enhanced Manhattan cityscape, one set to offer livelier, more engaging opportunities with which to put his sensational skills to use. Central to the expansive depth and detail being poured into The Amazing Spider-Man 2 video game is the new \"Hero or Menace\" system, which incentivizes Super Hero behavior by rewarding the web-slinger’s crime-fighting efforts, and adds consequences for letting criminality fester. Spider-Man’s personal brand of web-swinging and up-close-and-personal combat will see a variety of new features as well.",

    "Summary": "Discover history’s darkest secret in The Order: 1886, the game that re-writes history by introducing a unique vision of Victorian-Era London, where Man uses advanced technology to battle a powerful and ancient foe. In an alternate history where myths and technology co-exist, players take on the role of Sir Galahad, a hardened member of an elite order of Knights engaging in a centuries-old war that will determine the course of history forever. \r\n\r\nHundreds of years before the game’s version of 1886, humanity de-evolves and a subset of humans becomes the genetically different “Half-breeds.” War eventually breaks out between humans and Half-breeds for power and survival, and in order to combat these fierce enemies, a brotherhood was formed through the Knights of the Round Table – an alliance called The Order. The Knights of The Order have waged wars across centuries and sworn to defend humanity while protecting the secrets of this dark history. Strengthened by a mysterious liquid called Blackwater, the Knights of The Order are able to heal their wounds and extend their lifespans in order to engage this supernatural foe. \r\n\r\nThrough the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, The Order is now equipped with powerful weapons to turn the tide against the Half-breeds, but must also face a new threat. A rebellion emerges and the Rebels’ ranks are growing, as is their boldness, as they declare an all-out war against The Order and the government oppression it represents. Now, the Knights of The Order must face threats on all sides as they struggle to maintain peace and order.",

Schulz, which celebrated its 65th anniversary in 2015. Snoopy will explore the fantastical worlds of his imagination to track down Charlie Brown and his friends in an intricate game of hide-and-seek. As he follows their trails, Snoopy will acquire new costumes (based on his many alter egos) that provide unique abilities for overcoming obstacles and reaching new levels, including flight stages that let him take off as the Flying Ace. From the jungle to Paris to the moon itself, each environment is painted gorgeously in the same visual style as The Peanuts Movie to bring to life every colorful detail of Snoopy’s wild daydreams. The game also includes voice talent from the film.\r\n\r\nThe Peanuts Movie: Snoopy’s Grand Adventure challenges curiosities of any age with comfortable, pick-up-and-go controls and plenty of lighthearted surprises to discover. A second player can join the adventure as Woodstock to aid Snoopy by distracting creatures, opening new paths and helping locate hidden collectibles.",

Set in a heavily dystopian future as Earth nears the end of its life, those who remain in the overpopulated cities must work to survive as social programs become saturated by an ageing population and increasing environmental diseases. As the intelligence of technology incrementally increased over the years, many jobs for the human race had been made redundant, forcing Earth's citizens to head out into the suburbs seeking labor, aided by exoskeletons to improve their efficiency. The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.",
