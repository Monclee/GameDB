You play Manny Calavera, a mid-level worker at the Department of Death (the DOD) who's trying to work off his sins in life so that he can get to his final reward. As a reaper, Manny frees incoming souls from their shrouds, finds out what kind of underworld travel packages their goodness in life has earned them, and then sends them on their way. Unfortunately, business hasn't been very good for Manny of late. As the game begins, Calavera is told that he must sell a premium travel package to a soul or lose his job. In his search, Manny uncovers a hideous plot, a beautiful woman, and a crew of loyal friends (not necessarily in that order). \r\n\r\nBased on the acclaimed 1998 classic, this remake of Tim Schafer's original adventure title employs the stunning technology used to bring Broken Age to life for a fresh new way to experience Grim Fandango.",

    "Summary": "At least one hundred years have passed since the Great War consumed the planet. One hundred years since the human race ate hungrily of mother earth, squandering resources that could have carried them forward for millennia. In the heat of the sun, there is an unsettling, inescapable truth: man has fallen from his throne. Humanity now lives amongst the ruins left by a century of conflict, but from the wrecked steel of the past they will forge their own future. Lighter-than-air technology has inspired intrepid pioneers to take to the skies in search of trade and resources to support their towns and families. \r\n\r\nGuns of Icarus Online is the successor of the original Guns of Icarus -- a dieselpunk themed game that takes place in a barren and war torn land.  Communities had been isolated from each other with few traveling between them until Gabriel rediscovers flight in the form of a zeppelin and cargo ship combination, the Icarus.  This online expansion of the franchise focuses heavily on multiplayer airship combat.  Multiple players will be board a ship and carry out a ship’s many roles, many ships can be on a server and set the skies on fire with heavy firepower. Players are encouraged to work together while they are on a ship in order to fulfill the ship’s needs like managing repairs while shooting at enemies.  By specializing in one of the three available roles (classes) and communicating with shipmates, players will be able to rule the skies with an iron hand. As a part of Multiplayer Campaign, crews can aid towns in trade and affect the world ecosystem of Burren.",

The story unfolds amidst the repercussions of centuries worth of struggle, strife, and bloodshed between cultures, races and worldviews. But above all else, Heart Forth, Alicia is an ode to timeless 16- and 32-bit technique-based gameplay, with complex mechanics, and a set of unique, intertwining stories to take you on a fantastic journey. \r\n\r\nPlayers take the role of a young wizard named Alicia, a woman raised in the magical village of Brenia on the sky island Auster. Half a century ago, the Spirits cursed Brenia, and since that day no children have been born save two: Alicia, and her best friend Hostra. On the day of their Trial, the coming of age ceremony for youths in Brenia, one of the Spirits returns and wreaks havoc within their village. When the two young wizards attempt to flee to safety, Hostra comes under the spell of the Spirit and tosses Alicia from the island and into the Void below. As she fades away into the nothingness, Hostra returns to the village, slowly destroying it and its inhabitants. When Alicia awakens on solid ground, alive and well and certainly not lost in nothingness, she discovers something she had never imagined: a whole world lay beneath the clouds. Lost in a strange new land, Alicia sets out to find the means to return to her village and the power to save it.",

Building a new foundation for the Hitman franchise, you will find Agent 47 here as the aspirational assassin at the absolute peak of his power. As an operative of the International Contract Agency, his job is to take out high-profile targets all over the world, supported by his long-time handler Diana Burnwood. \r\n\r\nEach location in the game is a living sandbox, a place where every NPC has a name and every room matters. Players have complete freedom of approach over how, where and when you decide to take out your target. Creativity from players is fully expected -- you have the power and intelligence of Agent 47 at your fingertips, and it is your choice whether to use brute force or orchestrate a genuine masterpiece of assassination. An episodic structure for Hitman means an ongoing and evolving game which plays out over the course of a year, with a finale that brings the story arc together. Broadcast contract events add unique and vital missions to the Hitman experience over that time -- iImagine a target appearing for every player in the world, for a limited time only. Where your one shot counts. And when that target is gone, it is gone forever.",
