    "Summary": "The mystic 3rd-person exploration adventure AER puts players in the shoes of Auk, a pilgrim girl, to explore an unbelievable open world beneath her feet and wings. Wings? Yes, indeed! Auk has a rare gift: She can turn into a bird and is one of the few people who can reach even the most remote places in her homeland of flying islands, in search for the \"Memories of the Past\". On her journey she encounters other shape shifters, visits the ruins of the old gods and has to face dark creatures to revive the world of AER from menacing shadows. \r\n \r\nIn a genre mix between action adventure and flight exploration, players will join Auk on her pilgrimage. The surreal style of AER will be accompanied by reduced but colorful low poly graphics that underline the quiet tone of the game in a fitting way.",

Work to repel a brooding malevolence that has suffused Tokyo’s popular electronics district, Akihabara (Akiba for short), which has been painstakingly remodeled in the game to resemble its real life counterpart. Akiba has been invaded by creatures known as “Synthisters” who prey on the otaku patrons of Akihabara like vampires, but feast on their will to live and energy to socialize rather than their blood. Only direct exposure to sunlight can destroy the Synthisters, and it’s up to players to ensure that that’s just what they get. If only it weren’t for those pesky clothes protecting them from the sun’s harmful rays… \r\n\r\nThat’s where players come in. It’s their task to roam this sanctuary of anime and gaming fanatics, identify the outwardly human Synthisters with the help of a handy smartphone app, and then beat and pull at them until they’ve been relieved of their clothes, exposing them to sunlight and sending them to the netherworld. Everyday objects from baseball bats to comic books to motherboards can be used as weapons, and players can take their enemies’ unique clothing for their own personal use as well. \r\n\r\nAkiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed tells the story of a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap and transformed into one of the walking undead. Lucky enough to be spared the worst of his fate by the kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku, Nanashi is sworn to rid Akihabara of the Synthister threat. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by their kind.",

Although the puzzle-action game can be beaten by clearing all 100 rounds, it also contains secret elements such as not being able to get the \"true ending\" in single-player mode; hidden commands that lead to secret rounds; and a ton of different items. These elements are some of the game's most memorable and important features. Each round even has different air currents that are not visible, so bubbles rise in unpredictable patterns. Aspects like forcing players to understand and utilize these different patterns while playing help make this a revolutionary game that is fun to play anytime.",
