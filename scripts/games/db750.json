The game offers an  unprecedented new addition to the game‚Äôs play pattern in the form of Traptanium Traps. When this new type  of toy is placed directly into the Traptanium Portal. Portal Masters can ‚Äúcapture‚Äù a variety of special villains from the game and magically transport them from Skylands into the real world. Skylanders Trap Team also will reverse the magic of bringing toys-to-life, letting kids take characters out of the digital world and bring them into the physical world, pulling villains out of the game and into living room. Players can then send them back into the game where they play as them to fight for good.",

    "Summary": "Four game developers -- Douglas Wilson, Ramiro Corbetta, Bennett Foddy, and Noah Sasso -- join forces for this compendium of four highly acclaimed local multiplayer games: Johann Sebastian Joust, BaraBariBall, Super Pole Riders, and Hokra. All four games are accessible, spectator-friendly, and deeply replayable. \r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers. Players try to jostle their opponents' controllers while protecting their own. How fast you can move your controller depends on the varying tempo of the music. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! The goal is to be the last player remaining. \r\n\r\nBaraBariBall is a fighting/sports game for two or four players. Players score by dunking the ball in the water on the opposing team's side but lose a point for falling into the water themselves. In addition to a wide range of tactical maneuvers, players have seven air jumps, allowing for unprecedented control and ridiculously awesome aerial combat. BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities. \r\n\r\nSuper Pole Riders is an enhanced, extended version of the hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders, bringing the highly-technical, physics-based controls of the single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle. Two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole. \r\n\r\nHokra is a minimalist digital sports game. A fast-paced, competitive game for two teams of two players each, Hokra features simple controls and minimal rules while retaining the depth that makes multiplayer games exciting for advanced players. Like the sports from which it draws inspiration, Hokra is engaging to both player and spectators.",

The Jedi starfighter is the ship of choice for the Jedi, and unlike any other in the Star Wars universe. By virtue of a Jedi pilot, players will have a variety of unique Force powers at their fingertips throughout various points in the game. Force lightning saps the power systems of enemy ships and renders pilots unconscious. Force shield creates an energy barrier that deflects laser blasts. Force reflex simulates exaggerated reflexes and perception of the Jedi Knight pilot by putting the world in slow motion while the Jedi starship retains normal turning and shooting abilities. Force shockwave produces a powerful energy surge, which radiates multi-directionally. \r\n\r\nJedi Starfighter introduces players to the two main characters and their starships through a mini-training campaign. In one-player mode, players will fly as Adi Gallia and Nym. Adi Gallia, a well-respected and very skillful Jedi Master, pilots the Jedi starfighter. Nym, a former pirate who has become a powerful rebel leader, flies the Havoc, which has been upgraded from the original game with three new weapons: cruise missiles, cluster missiles, and proximity mines. Two-player cooperative mode features additional supporting characters and ships",
