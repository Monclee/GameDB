    "Summary": "Mafia III combines cinematic storytelling with a dynamic narrative structure that responds to player choices. Set in a reimagined New Orleans in 1968 -- one of the most tumultuous years in American history -- Mafia III follows the story of Lincoln Clay, a disenfranchised Vietnam veteran, returning from combat and looking for a home and a place to belong. Orphaned as a child, Lincoln at last achieves a semblance of family with the city’s black mob, finding the surrogate father and brother he has longed for. But when Lincoln’s new family is betrayed and slaughtered by the Italian mob, he becomes fixated on revenge and wages a brutal war against the Italians, disrupting the balance of power in the seedy underworld of New Orleans. \r\n\r\nThroughout the riveting story of Mafia III, players choose their path to revenge and build their own crime empire using cunning, stalking and deception, or through overwhelming force and firepower. Mafia III combines cinematic storytelling with a dynamic narrative structure that responds to player choices, set in a vibrant city that responds to Lincoln’s actions. As the story progresses, Lincoln allies himself with other criminals and builds an empire and a new family of his own that transforms the city.",

You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. But will they even listen? Rather than stand united, the factions of the Metro are locked in a struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults of D6.

Your ability to move in the fourth dimension in addition to the usual three allows you to perform miraculous feats like walk through walls, see inside closed buildings, steal objects from closed containers, make object float in mid-air, bind two separate rings without breaking them, etc...",
