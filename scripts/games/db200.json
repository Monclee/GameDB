The adventure begins when the player washes ashore along the coast of this war ridden peninsula and is thrown into intrigue full of tragedy and betrayal. In line with classic turn-based roleplaying mechanics, Demons Age first tasks players to set up their character and later allows them to hire a party of diverse characters to help them on their adventure. \r\n\r\nEach hired character has their own secrets and back-story, so players must choose their party wisely and beware of potential betrayals. Players can level-up their characters playing through the main story and also side quests, receiving rewards as they help the citizens of Moragon all the while searching for the cause of the mysterious event that has plunged the kingdom into evil darkness. Solving puzzles allows players to progress through the game, and they can find and equip a host of different weapons to defeat foes. Combining a lavish look with the dense atmosphere of a classic dungeon crawler, Demons Age is designed to appeal to new and old fans of turn-based fantasy role-playing games, and true to the genre.

    "Summary": "Divekick distills the essence of the fighting genre into a two-button, no-joystick, rage-inducing form that can be enjoyed by anyone. You have no traditional directional movement.  You can only dive into the air with the Dive button (it's a jump) and then propel yourself toward the ground with a mighty kick, using the Kick button.  Kicking while on the ground will cause you to bounce away from your opponent.  The first hit wins each round; first to five rounds wins the game!\r\n\r\nAs simple as this sounds, trust that underestimating your opponent is a dangerous mistake.  Movement is unorthodox, and players are unable to guard against incoming attacks.  Finding the optimal spot to stand in order to score a counter is key, but actually standing in that position is a lot harder than you'd think!  Players can also build up their Kick-Meter to activate Kick-Factor, a super charged mode in which your character dives higher and kicks faster. Watch your head, however, as one solid foot to the face scores a headshot and leaves you with a concussion in the next round.  Stunned players don't dive as high or kick as fast, leaving them at a massive disadvantage.",

    "Summary": "Devil May Cry brand new tears -- DmC reinvents Capcom's classic action franchise to explore new frontiers with the series. The \"Devil May Cry DNA\" of stylish action, rewarding combat and a brash, smart-talking protagonist all remains; however, it has now injected with a dark and brutal gameplay that promises to redefine the franchise. \r\n\r\nThe Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. He is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement.\r\n\r\nThe Definitive Edition of DmC kicks up the action with eye-blistering 1080p resolution at 60fps. Ninja Theory has thoroughly examined the entire game based on feedback to make it tighter than ever. Also, all DLC from DmC (including costumes, weapon skins, the pre-order bonus items) as well as the Vergil's Downfall campaign are included. Added in is a new \"Bloody Palace\" mode for Vergil, featuring sixty waves of stylish madness. Turbo Mode, Hardcore Mode, Must Style Mode, Gods Must Die difficulty level, and so much more are added to make this the definitive release of DmC.",

That was 11,432 days ago. To make matters worse, an alien that looks like a green hot-dog, named Alien Jeff, finds you and gives you some bad news: It turns out your model is getting recalled and scrapped, because you apparently don't have enough \"humanity\", whatever that is. Alien Jeff has been assigned the task of discovering just how much \"humanity\" you are capable of, and reporting back to the company. \r\n\r\nSo together, you travel around the Universe on a giant flying thingy and visit themed planets, interacting with its bizarre inhabitants, and Alien Jeff will be watching you the whole time. While you’re traveling the Universe, you’ll also stop at many tiny asteroids where you can take fun, visual personality tests. You can get a full personality report from the Therapist who lives on your home planet, which by the way, you get to decorate. You even get to visit your friend's home planets and check out their personality reports. Doki-Doki Universe is more than just a game, and only by exploring this vast and bizarre cosmos while interacting with real friends here on planet Earth might you understand what this thing called \"humanity\" really is.",
