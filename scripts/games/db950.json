Players can level-up their characters playing through the main story and also side quests, receiving rewards as they help the citizens of Moragon all the while searching for the cause of the mysterious event that has plunged the kingdom into evil darkness. Solving puzzles allows players to progress through the game, and they can find and equip a host of different weapons to defeat foes. Combining a lavish look with the dense atmosphere of a classic dungeon crawler, Demons Age is designed to appeal to new and old fans of turn-based fantasy role-playing games, and true to the genre. There is danger lurking around every corner.","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Release Date":"Q1 2016","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/08/01/demons-age-button-phjpg-73e5e5_160w.jpg"},{"Release Date":"Q1 2016","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/08/01/demons-age-button-phjpg-73e5e5_160w.jpg"},{"Release Date":"Q1 2016","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/08/01/demons-age-button-phjpg-73e5e5_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"October 21, 2014","M for Mature":"Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol and Tobacco","Genre":"Adventure","Publisher":"Telltale Games","Developer":"Telltale Games","Summary":"The walkers keep on coming.

The air is thick with tension and the smoke of burnt villages. The fearsome Empire of Nilfgaard has struck again, ravaging the hapless Northern Kingdoms. The once-mighty who tried to use Geralt for their own gain are now gone. In these uncertain times, no one can say what fortune holds in store, who will bring peace to the world and who will cause it only misery. But a force darker and deadlier emerges. The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is child’s play compared to the Wild Hunt, the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly spectral riders have for ages plagued humankind, bringing misery to the world. Yet this time the Wild Hunt seeks one person in particular: the one individual Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one soul Geralt considers kin.  \r\n\r\nThe climactic third game in the fantasy RPG series, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a unique combination of a non-linear story and an open world -- a character-driven, non-linear story experience focused on player choice, tactical combat and a rich, living environment. This world is populated with intelligent inhabitants and animated by new mechanics that make it a dynamic, living, breathing place. As players travel the world, witnessing many a sunrise or sunset, enduring torrential rains or sweltering heat, they see predators hunting their prey, villages defending themselves against monsters, lovers meeting by moonlight. The new in-game economy system varies the price of goods based on surrounding conditions or their place of origin, encouraging players to seek out through hunting and collecting items that are in demand.

It’s their task to roam this sanctuary of anime and gaming fanatics, identify the outwardly human Synthisters with the help of a handy smartphone app, and then beat and pull at them until they’ve been relieved of their clothes, exposing them to sunlight and sending them to the netherworld. Everyday objects from baseball bats to comic books to motherboards can be used as weapons, and players can take their enemies’ unique clothing for their own personal use as well. \r\n\r\nAkiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed tells the story of a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap and transformed into one of the walking undead. Lucky enough to be spared the worst of his fate by the kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku, Nanashi is sworn to rid Akihabara of the Synthister threat. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by their kind.","Rating":null,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"NIS","Release Date":"Q4 2014","MSRP":"","Region":"JP","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/03/12/akibas-trip-button-01jpg-e316d9_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"NIS","Release Date":"Q4 2014","MSRP":"","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/03/12/akibas-trip-button-01jpg-e316d9_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"NIS","Release Date":"Q4 2014","MSRP":"","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/03/12/akibas-trip-button-01jpg-e316d9_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"NIS","Release Date":"Q4 2014","MSRP":"","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/03/12/akibas-trip-button-01jpg-e316d9_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"TBA","Genre":"Racing","Publisher":"R8 Games","Developer":"R8 Games","Summary":"Formula Fusion is a futuristic racing game created by R8 Games, a team formed by members previously on the Wipeout design team.","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"R8 Games","Release Date":"TBA","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/09/25/slamjet-placeholderjpg-57ce4a_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"R8 Games","Release Date":"TBA","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/09/25/slamjet-placeholderjpg-57ce4a_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"R8 Games","Release Date":"TBA","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/09/25/slamjet-placeholderjpg-57ce4a_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"October 14, 2014","E for Everyone":"Comic Mischief, Includes online features that may expose players to unrated user-generated content, Indicates possible exposure to unfiltered/uncensored user-generated content, including user-to-user interactions and media sharing via social media and networks","Genre":"Puzzle","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","Developer":"PopCap Games","Summary":"One of the greatest arcade-style puzzle games ever finally sees a sequel with the long-awaited Peggle 2!\r\n\r\nPeggle 2 propels players to the peg-popping paradise of the original Peggle game while delivering a host of new features and functionality.

The historically accurate architecture and in-game events will flavor the three major cities found in Raven’s Cry with the atmosphere players crave, as they traverse from the unsavory pirate holdfast of Port Royal to the elegant avenues of luscious Havana, to a lost Aztec City deep in the jungles of the Spanish Main.","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"TopWare Interactive","Release Date":"TBA","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/08/29/ravens-cry-generaljpg-e94151_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"TopWare Interactive","Release Date":"TBA","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/08/29/ravens-cry-generaljpg-e94151_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"TopWare Interactive","Release Date":"TBA","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/08/29/ravens-cry-generaljpg-e94151_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"TBA 2016","Genre":"Music","Publisher":"Drool","Developer":"Drool","Summary":"Thumper combines classic rhythm-action with speed and physicality.

A massive wall stands between the wealthy and the poor as Rena Nakano, cyborg and president of Nexus Roku Corporation, leads the country into darkness. Manufacturing augmentations for human beings, Nexus Roku promises an easier life. But by embedding chips into their patients and buying out those who would expose them, Nexus Roku is able to alter the behavioral patterns of society to be docile and compliant, giving Rena Nakano unrivaled power and control. Once used to seal away the Tengu Demon Sojobo, Rena Nakano is in search for the ancient pearl in hopes that upon freeing Sojobo, he will grant her immortality as a reward. Within this societal turbulence, a handful of unlikely heroes find themselves leading the resistance not only to Rena Nakano’s greed, but perhaps saving the world from Sojobo, and ultimately death, altogether. Based on the real historical swordsman, Musashi Miyamoto leads this group through a plot teeming with deceit, violence, love, betrayal and sacrifice against a backdrop inspired by traditional Japanese lore. Rich with philosophical themes and generous subtext, Reborn tells a tale that asks the question, “What is freedom without free will?” \r\n\r\nReborn is a sci-fi action RPG with the real-time combat of action games and the depth of traditional RPGs, including an experience and leveling system, progressive License Board, rare loot, and various character classes , and downloadable content (upon reaching higher stretch goals.) Reborn follows the high energy adventures of a futuristic version of the famed Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto. The year is 2188; the people of Japan once embraced a life of spirituality and harmony with nature, but now they’re obsessed with technology, forcing it into every aspect of their lives, becoming willing slaves. But some see the destruction of their culture, and rebel against the modern system. As Musashi, you will travel the streets of Neo-Tokyo, clashing with cyber-enhanced gangs and oppressive corporate overlords in your attempt to find “a better path.”","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Acttil","Release Date":"TBA 2015","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/02/27/reborn-game-button-00jpg-9ec060_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Acttil","Release Date":"TBA 2015","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/02/27/reborn-game-button-00jpg-9ec060_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Acttil","Release Date":"TBA 2015","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/02/27/reborn-game-button-00jpg-9ec060_160w.jpg"}]},{"Genre":"Action","Publisher":"Square Enix","Developer":"PlatinumGames","Summary":"","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Square Enix","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/nier-project-buttonjpg-0e245b_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Square Enix","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/nier-project-buttonjpg-0e245b_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Square Enix","Region":"JP","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/nier-project-buttonjpg-0e245b_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Square Enix","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/nier-project-buttonjpg-0e245b_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"June 3, 2014","E for Everyone":"Mild Fantasy Violence","Genre":"Shooter","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Developers":"Double Eleven Studios, Q-Games","Summary":"","Rating":null,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Release Date":"June 4, 2014","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/06/pixeljunk-shooter-ps4-v1jpg-958874_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Release Date":"June 4, 2014","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/06/pixeljunk-shooter-ps4-v1jpg-958874_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Release Date":"June 4, 2014","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/06/pixeljunk-shooter-ps4-v1jpg-958874_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"November 18, 2014","T for Teen":"Violence, Blood","Genre":"Shooter","Publisher":"Wired Productions","Developer":"Kukouri Mobile Entertainment","Summary":"The Tiny Troopers are deploying on your favorite PlayStation gaming system in this joint ops pack of the shooter phenomenon that combines both Tiny Troopers and Tiny Troopers 2: Special Ops campaigns in one action-packed game.","Rating":null,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Wired Productions","Release Date":"November 19, 2014","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/11/tiny-troopers-joint-ops-buttonjpg-e31616_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Wired Productions","Release Date":"November 19, 2014","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/11/tiny-troopers-joint-ops-buttonjpg-e31616_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Wired Productions","Release Date":"November 19, 2014","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/11/tiny-troopers-joint-ops-buttonjpg-e31616_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"December 16, 2014","E for Everyone":"Alcohol and Tobacco Reference","Genre":"Sports","Publisher":"Metalhead Software","Developer":"Metalhead Software","Summary":"Hammer Longballo and a friendly cast of semi-athletic baseball stars invite you to saddle up on the couch with friends for Super Mega Baseball.

You have no traditional directional movement.  You can only dive into the air with the Dive button (it's a jump) and then propel yourself toward the ground with a mighty kick, using the Kick button.  Kicking while on the ground will cause you to bounce away from your opponent.  The first hit wins each round; first to five rounds wins the game!\r\n\r\nAs simple as this sounds, trust that underestimating your opponent is a dangerous mistake.  Movement is unorthodox, and players are unable to guard against incoming attacks.  Finding the optimal spot to stand in order to score a counter is key, but actually standing in that position is a lot harder than you'd think!  Players can also build up their Kick-Meter to activate Kick-Factor, a super charged mode in which your character dives higher and kicks faster. Watch your head, however, as one solid foot to the face scores a headshot and leaves you with a concussion in the next round.  Stunned players don't dive as high or kick as fast, leaving them at a massive disadvantage.","Rating":null,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Iron Galaxy Studios","Release Date":"October 8, 2014","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/27/divekick-ps4jpg-e31f00_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Iron Galaxy Studios","Release Date":"October 8, 2014","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/27/divekick-ps4jpg-e31f00_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Iron Galaxy Studios","Release Date":"October 8, 2014","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/03/27/divekick-ps4jpg-e31f00_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"September 30, 2015","E10+ for Everyone 10 and older":"Fantasy Violence","Genre":"Compilation","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Developer":"thatgamecompany (TGC)","Summary":"The collector's edition of Journey brings the epic adventure game from acclaimed game design studio thatgamecompany to Blu-Ray for the first time, and brings with it two more top titles -- flOw and Flower -- as well as a raft of exclusive new bonuses and previously released digital content.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY: An exotic adventure with a more serious tone, Journey presents a unique vision of an online adventure experience.

Caught up in the events of The War of the Five Kings, they are placed in a precarious position where members of the household must do everything they can to prevent the house from meeting its doom. This six-episode game series begins with events towards the end of Season Three of the TV show, and ends right before the beginning of Season Five. You will visit familiar locations such as King's Landing and The Wall, as well as unfamiliar locations such as Ironrath, the home of House Forrester. You will play the game from five different points of view. Each character you play as is a member of House Forrester; either a direct family member, or a person in service to the House. Scattered across Westeros and Essos, each character will play their part in seeking to save House Forrester from destruction. \r\n\r\nHouse Forrester is a noble house from the Wolfswood in the north of Westeros. Bannermen to House Glover, they have always offered unswerving loyalty to the ruling great house of the North – the Starks. The Forresters are seated at Ironrath, an imposing stronghold surrounded by towering ironwood trees. Built over fifteen hundred years ago by Cedric Forrester and his triplet sons, Ironrath is a testament to the strength and endurance of Ironwood. The Forrester house words are 'Iron from Ice', which echoes their belief that -- like the ironwood itself -- the adverse conditions and unforgiving landscape of the North only makes them stronger.","Rating":null,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Telltale Games","Release Date":"December 2, 2014 [Episode 1 Launch]","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/11/20/game-of-thrones-button-logojpg-e14ea8_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Telltale Games","Release Date":"December 2, 2014 [Episode 1 Launch]","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/11/20/game-of-thrones-button-logojpg-e14ea8_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Telltale Games","Release Date":"December 2, 2014 [Episode 1 Launch]","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/11/20/game-of-thrones-button-logojpg-e14ea8_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"August 19, 2014","E10+ for Everyone 10 and older":"Animated Blood, Crude Humor, Fantasy Violence, Includes online features that may expose players to unrated user-generated content","Genre":"Strategy","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","Developer":"PopCap Games","Summary":"The zombies once again storm the yard and ignite garden warfare in this sequel to the quirky, one-of-a-kind strategy game Plants vs. Zombies.

Inspired by the reality of counter terrorist operatives across the world, Rainbow 6 Siege invites players to master the art of destruction. Intense close quarters confrontations, high lethality, tactics, team play, and explosive action are at the center of the experience. \r\n\r\nFor the first time in a Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six game, players will engage in sieges, a new style of assault where enemies have the means to transform their environments into modern strongholds while Rainbow Six teams lead the assault to breach the enemy’s position.  Rainbow Six Siege gives players unprecedented control over their ability to fortify their position -- by reinforcing walls and floors, using barbed wire, deployable shields and mines, and more -- or breach the enemies’ using observation drones, sheet charges, rappelling, and more. The fast pace, lethality and uniqueness of each siege sets a new bar for intense firefights, strategic gameplay and competitive gaming. \r\n\r\nTom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege also features a technological breakthrough that redefines the way players interact with a game environment. Leveraging Ubisoft Montreal’s proprietary Realblast engine, Rainbow Six Siege incorporates procedural destruction that is realistic and unscripted, meaning the environment reacts authentically, distinctively and dynamically, based on variables like the caliber of bullets or the amount of explosives used. This advance allows players to leverage destruction in meaningful ways. Walls can be shattered, opening new lines of fire. Ceilings and floors can be breached to create new access points. This ability to modify the level design in real time enables players to create new gameplay opportunities directly within the game level.","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Ubisoft","Release Date":"December 1, 2015","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/03/31/r6-siege-button-02jpg-b778df_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Ubisoft","Release Date":"December 1, 2015","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/03/31/r6-siege-us-rp-ps4jpg-bfce8c_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Ubisoft","Release Date":"December 1, 2015","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/03/31/r6-siege-button-02jpg-b778df_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"September 1, 2015","E for Everyone":"Mild Fantasy Violence, Mild Language","Genre":"Adventure","Publisher":"Funktronic Labs","Developer":"Funktronic Labs","Summary":"NOVA-111 is a sci-fi themed turn-based adventure game with a twist of real-time action!

In an alternate history where myths and technology co-exist, players take on the role of Sir Galahad, a hardened member of an elite order of Knights engaging in a centuries-old war that will determine the course of history forever. \r\n\r\nHundreds of years before the game’s version of 1886, humanity de-evolves and a subset of humans becomes the genetically different “Half-breeds.” War eventually breaks out between humans and Half-breeds for power and survival, and in order to combat these fierce enemies, a brotherhood was formed through the Knights of the Round Table – an alliance called The Order. The Knights of The Order have waged wars across centuries and sworn to defend humanity while protecting the secrets of this dark history.

All four games are accessible, spectator-friendly, and deeply replayable. \r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers. Players try to jostle their opponents' controllers while protecting their own. How fast you can move your controller depends on the varying tempo of the music. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! The goal is to be the last player remaining. \r\n\r\nBaraBariBall is a fighting/sports game for two or four players. Players score by dunking the ball in the water on the opposing team's side but lose a point for falling into the water themselves. In addition to a wide range of tactical maneuvers, players have seven air jumps, allowing for unprecedented control and ridiculously awesome aerial combat. BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities. \r\n\r\nSuper Pole Riders is an enhanced, extended version of the hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders, bringing the highly-technical, physics-based controls of the single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle. Two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole. \r\n\r\nHokra is a minimalist digital sports game. A fast-paced, competitive game for two teams of two players each, Hokra features simple controls and minimal rules while retaining the depth that makes multiplayer games exciting for advanced players. Like the sports from which it draws inspiration, Hokra is engaging to both player and spectators.","Rating":8.7,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Independent","Release Date":"May 6, 2014","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/10/16/sportsfriends-generaljpg-e958d5_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Independent","Release Date":"May 6, 2014","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/10/16/sportsfriends-generaljpg-e958d5_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Independent","Release Date":"May 6, 2014","Region":"US","Cover":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/10/16/sportsfriends-generaljpg-e958d5_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"TBA 2016","RP for Rating Pending":"","Genre":"Adventure","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Developers":"Giant Sparrow, SCE Studios San Diego","Summary":"Edith Finch is a surreal first-person painting game inspired by classic children’s books.","Rating":0,"Releases":[{"Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Release Date":"TBA 2016","Region":"AU","Cover":"http://tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/object/162/162999/Edith-Finch_LOGOboxart_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Release Date":"TBA 2016","Region":"US","Cover":"http://tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/object/162/162999/Edith-Finch_LOGOboxart_160w.jpg"},{"Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Release Date":"TBA 2016","Region":"UK","Cover":"http://tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/object/162/162999/Edith-Finch_LOGOboxart_160w.jpg"}]},{"Release Date":"April 28, 2015","T for Teen":"Violence","Genre":"Shooter","Publisher":"OPQAM","Developer":"OPQAM","Summary":"Take to the skies in Project Root, an explosion-laden overhead shooter.
