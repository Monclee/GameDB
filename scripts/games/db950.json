You must tackle the changing needs of your people, as well as opposing governments and factions, and thus lay the foundations for your own dynasty. As you move through your years in office you can promote members of your extended family on the island to positions of power: such as ambassador, commanding general or even Supreme Ruler, to ensure your legacy thrives through the eras. As your influence and wealth grows, so do the threats to your burgeoning island superpower. Can you survive both World Wars, prosper through the Great Depression, rule as an iron-fisted dictator through the Cold War and advance your country to modern times and beyond? From the 19th to the 21st century, each era carries its own challenges and opportunities. \r\n\r\nAs well as a wealth of other new features, including advanced trading mechanics, technology, scientific research trees and island exploration, Tropico 5 will add cooperative and competitive multiplayer for up to four players for the first time in the series’ history!

    "Summary": "Locksley doesn't kill. That would be far too easy. Instead, he commits his crimes through stealth. Sneaking, distracting, avoiding. He is never seen, and seldom heard. As he grows in popularity and notoriety, so will his inventory. An arsenal of gadgets await discovery in a quest to rob from the rich and give to the unheard. \r\n\r\nVolume is a near-future stealth-action retelling of the Robin Hood legend, starring Danny Wallace (Thomas Was Alone), Charlie McDonnell and award-winning, critically-acclaimed actor Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings, Planet of the Apes) as Gisborne. A hundred challenging and exciting levels lie ahead, but that is only the beginning of the Volume. The community are free to build their own challenges, even releasing their own takes on the core levels. Volume will evolve, warp and grow as players make their mark on Locksley's legend.",

Players take on a new campaign starring Raymond \"T-Bone\" Kenney, the brilliant and eccentric hacker from the original campaign. T-Bone’s story begins as he is planting a false trail at Blume and receives a panicked phone call from his former Blume colleague, Tobias Frewer, in desperate need of help. T-Bone decides to help Tobias, but quickly realizes the details of his old friend’s story aren't adding up... \r\n\r\nWatch Dogs: Bad Blood also grants players access to Street Sweep contracts, a dynamic new system of side missions offering endless hours of challenges. A first for Watch_Dogs, Street Sweep contracts are playable in co-op, friend or public sessions, allowing two players to work together to combat Chicago’s criminal groups. The popular online Hacking and Tailing modes, as well as the ctOS mobile companion app, are fully playable with T-Bone in Watch Dogs: Bad Blood. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Watch Dogs: Bad Blood features exclusive weapons, perks and outfits, including the remote-control car, Eugene, T-Bone’s latest creation, which can be upgraded with both offensive and defensive perks.",

The game blends third-person action, exploration and puzzle-solving with the mature tension, challenge and tone of old-school survival horror adventures. As players investigate a shadowy mansion in the dead of night after a near-fatal car crash, what started as a search for aid will become a desperate quest to unearth the secrets behind the manor’s tortured past. \r\n\r\nWhite Night's stylish black-and-white art direction plays pivotally into its underlying mechanics. Light cuts through the darkness to reveal hidden paths and clues, providing a sanctuary against the terrors lurking the estate--but it’s a resource that must be managed carefully. White Night’s cinematic atmosphere is further advanced with immersive sound design, a haunting soundtrack and chilling vocal performances.",
